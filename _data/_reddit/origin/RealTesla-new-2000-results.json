      "score": 1311,
      "selftext": "IMHO, Tesla has peaked. Today's news is bad, but the reason I know they've peaked is that they have nothing good in the pipeline. The best idea anyone can come up with at Tesla HQ is to produce a small car, which anyone in the industy will tell you is hard. **Really, really hard**. So hard that most automakers don't even bother. So hard that if Tesla actually develops the Model2,it could be their undoing.\n\nInstead, I believe we've arrived at peak Tesla. They'll keep selling cars because they have some cachet, and they'll make money because they have economies of scale, but they'll never be bigger than they were last year.\n\nWhen historians look back, they'll see Tesla fucked up their vehicle development plan almost immediately after Elon got his hands in things and fired Rawlinson:\n\n* **Roadster was a glorified concept**, but it did it's job and put them on the map. I'd write it down as a win.\n* **Releasing the S first was fine.** Larger sedans are profitable (albeit low volume), and they can act as a platform for a mid-size crossover (also profitable). And Elon had a real pro managing things back then (Rawlinson) so it was a great car all things considered. I'd write the S down as a win too.\n* **Model X was an unmitigated disaster**. It should have been what the Y was to the 3 - an upsized version of the S. Instead, it was Elon's gullwing door fuckup. It cost the company a lot of momentum and potentially 2 *years* of wasted product development time. 2 years they'll never get back. 2 years that future analysis will point to as evidence of Elon's gross mismanagement. 2 years that likely sealed Tesla's fait as an also-ran.\n* **Tesla completely missed out on the commercial delivery vehicle business**. When Tesla's engineers were screwing around with gullwing doors, they should have been developing a cheap electric delivery van. Delivery vehicles are ideal for BEV powertrains, as they don't drive far and they're highly visible. But Tesla ignored that business and Rivian is the beneficiary. Not to mention, a van platform would have been relatively easy to turn into a mid-size truck platform (see Honda Odyssey).\n* **Model 3 was previewed way too early - it should have been shown a year or so later alongside a Model Y prototype**. Both vehicles could have been developed at the same time on the same platform to maximize efficiency. Also, Tesla could have avoided producing cars in a fucking tent (which will go down in auto manufacturing history as one of the most ridiculous things any automaker has ever done) and just planned production for Austin.\n   * Allegedly, Tesla rushed the Model 3 reveal b/c they were in dire financial straits, no doubt because of mismanaged capital investments.\n* **Oh, and the Nevada battery plant was a collossal fuck-up too**. Elon's emphasis on vertical integration will not be looked upon fondly whenever his biography is written. All automakers *used* to be vertically integrated, but over time they learned that vertical integration is inherently risky. Why build, own, and maintain an entire manufacturing plant when you can just negotiate a good deal on the products the plant produces, with no long term obligations? Way less risk if there's a change in the business environment (like a slowdown) or a change in technology (like solid state batteries). That Nevada battery plant is going to be a boat anchor for a very long time.\n* **Tesla Semi was just a run of the mill fuck-up, assuming they half-assed it**. I don't blame Tesla for playing with the concept of a BEV big rig - it's highly visible and it might make sense as a port vehicle or local delivery vehicle - but it was a distraction. There's not a lot of money in big rigs unless you're selling parts for them (very much a feast or famine industry - most automakers don't bother for a reason). Assuming Tesla didn't sink a lot of time or money into that concept, it's just a run of the mill fuck-up.\n* **Model S, Model X, and Model 3 refresh were never planned, which is just fucking hilarious**. Somehow Tesla failed to understand the importance of a 3-4 year vehicle refresh cadence. Collossal fuck-up, *especially* when you consider Tesla should have known better by 2017 or so and STILL didn't make plans to refresh the 3 until last year! It's like they're not even paying attention, LOL.\n* **Cybertruck was/is a distraction**. Niche vehicles are fun and can have a halo effect, but they almost never make money. They're too low volume to ever cover the up-front costs. From all accounts, Tesla spent way too much time and money on developing a truck that *might* sell 50k units this year. I predict it will be cancelled in 2031 (maybe sooner).\n* **Model Y was released a bit too late, but was well received and has been profitable**. It's kind of boring, but boring pays the bills. I'd write it down as a win too, and if I was in charge at Tesla I'd put whomever was in charge of the Y in charge of future product dev. It's not perfect or anything like that, but someone knows what they're doing.\n* **Roadster 2 is bullshit**. I doubt anyone has done any serious work on that, but who knows. Tesla is mismanaged enough to sink funds into *another* halo car even as the house as on fire, but I doubt it. I think it's vaporware.\n\nAll in all, Tesla fucked up on half of the models they've developed. Compared to GM and Chrysler in the 1990s and early 2000s, that's not bad. And if this was 2004 and not 2024, Tesla would very much be in the game. But, unfortunately for Elon, he's not competing with GM or Chrysler from the 1990s or early 2000s.\n\nBut the real dick kick for Elon and Tesla is that THERE'S NOTHING IN THE HOPPER. They let Rivian have the stylish 3 row crossover market, as well as the cool off-road mid-size pickup market, and also the light commercial market. Rivian sends their thanks.\n\nAnd they've let Lucid beat them on the flagship big sedan market, which means everything is riding on the Model 3 and the Model Y. Not great.\n\nAnd the rest of the automakers are about to kick the door in, especially Hyundai and VW. Shit only gets harder from this point forward...which means Tesla has peaked.\n\n**Where do we go from here**: Tesla will slowly lose market share. They'll make grandiose statements about this or that, and they'll probably produce a couple of cool concepts in the next 5 years or so. But because of competition, they won't grow sales.\n\nAs the Tesla fleet ages, their service centers will produce significant profits and prop the company up even as their models flop. And I'm sure the Tesla faithful will stay engaged as long as Elon Elons. But at some point, Tesla will sell a significant share of the company to another automaker, and fall under that automakers umbrella...sort of like how Mitsubishi motors is under the Nissan-Renault umbrella.\n\nAnd eventually Elon will find a pink slip on his desk, and he'll start a podcast or something where he rails about this and that, kind of like Bob Lutz did. But in a more embarrassing manner.\n\nThe end.",

FSD can't Google or write codes for help. There aren't enough edge case data for training (happens too rarely).\n\nSo don't hold your breath if you hope FSD will rescue the company. \n\nIf you watch YouTube video of FSD Director Ashok, it's obvious that he doesn't have a PhD in AI, just a Master in Robotics. A true expert in AI is rarer than people think. Yann LeCun, a Godfather of AI, thinks Elon is full of shit. ",

      "selftext": "Apologize upfront for not being an Enron or Tesla specific post.\n\nI personally think a hybrid vehicle with 62 mi 100km pure EV range is the sweet spot. 60mi would cover 100% of daily commuting needs. 60mi means the battery can be relatively compact and light. Also, as density improves ever more (especially with solid-state) it can probably be small enough to fit underneath the backseat kind of like Toyota's current hybrid lineup. This means it will have huge flexibility and such setup can be installed on multiple vehicle types; big, small, truck/4x4, and sports car without much fuss, reducing costs overall. This flexible setup can also be applied to both unibody and body-on-frame construction. It is not just restricted to unibody, skateboard construction like most if not all BEVs are, so it really increases the specialized capability/strength of the vehicle.\n\nLighter battery also means that when the battery runs out of juice the MPG would not be as atrocius as those other PHEV which may have longer EV range but has bigger heavier battery to carry around.\n\nOf course, in longer-ranged trip passing through remote middle of nowhere with little to no infrastructure, you still got engine and gas which can charge the battery too.\n\nTechnically some PHEV vehicle already have 60mi EV range like Karma GS-6 but that is very expensive unobtanium. Luxury PHEV like from Range Rover, BMW and Mercedes are pretty long range but they still hover around 50mi and have huge battery. Same for those Chinese Li Auto or BYD PHEV that seem to have very impressive EV only range like 200km+ but only in Chinese rating, requires huge battery to achieve it and surprisingly expensive (thus medicore MPG and even EPA EV range likely). Longest range \"normal\" everyday PHEV and arguable the best middle-ground is the RAV4 prime at 42mi but I still think the battery needs to be smaller.\n\nTL:DR : Overall, I think if we can get hybrids to reach 60mi EV range with battery size small enough to be fitted underneath the backseat, this is the best and probably reduce the appeal and drawback of EV",

      "selftext": "First of all, I'll be honest, I like the cars and I own 2 of them. Are they underwhelming in the fit and finish department, sure, but I love the ease of use, the software and the app. I do not approve of the CEO, but I feel like I probably wouldn't like a lot of CEOs if they were as vocal as Musk on social media.\n\nYesterday morning, I got the notification on my '23 Model 3 that a \"Full Self Driving (Supervised)\" trail was no available for my use. I suppose you could call me indifferent about my opinion of the program, as I had only seen clips of it's best and worst moments online. Let me tell ya, it's bad. It's so bad that I'm shocked that they have released it to so many owners at once.\n\nI left for school and decided to turn it on after plugging in my destination. It did okay for someone who was a student driver for the first stretch of surface streets. Then it came time for the turn onto the 15 freeway. Two turn lanes, one with no cars and the other with two semis. It chose to get behind the semis. Amateur move for sure, but I digress. It proceeds to merge and do fairly well for the next 10 miles of freeway (the 10). I was pleasantly surprised made the exit for the 15 southbound without any issues. But that's where my praise ends.\n\nOn the ramp to the 15 S, it insists on pacing a cement truck with its left blinker on. Plenty of room to merge behind the truck and there wasn't anyone close behind me. The car attempted to come to a stop as the on ramp ended, and the FSD cancelled out. Luckily, I was able to safely merge into traffic on my own after. \n\nI got back onto the freeway and reengage the FSD. With my route still programmed, it made its way over to the exit, and proceeded to run over some palm tree debris. Made a quick right turn and needed to make its way over one lane to make the following left turn. It insisted on making it's way to the far left lane. Turned left and then crossed the lane markings over to the right lane without signaling. I disengaged after.\n\nI arrived at my school and was looking for a place to parallel park. It showed on the infotainment screen that it was able to park in a nearby spot. I figured I would give that a shot, why not. It started off good. It aligned itself with the car in front of the spot and started backing in. Luckily I had my foot over the brake in case, because it came within a few inches of smashing the car behind me. The camera couldn't properly decipher the front air dam of the car behind me I assume.\n\nAs my day finished, I thought I'd give the FSD another shot. I figured maybe the sun just coming up had an affect on its abilities that morning. It did pretty well making it's way back home for 3/4 of the drive, outside of being too shy and unassertive (I was in \"assertive\" mode). My exit for home is coming up and it's in the far left lane. 2 miles until the exit, no attempt to move over. It didn't finally start to cross the 5 lanes of traffic until about a half mile from the exit itself. When it finally made it over to the correct lane, it was too late for it to move into the exit lane and it was too cautious to take advantage of the gaps available to move over. It made several attempts at turning on its right signal, and kind of shuttering like an apprehensive driver, but ends up completely missing the exit.\n\nIt decides to take me to the following exit, luckily we were already in the necessary lane for this. Exited fine and did okay until turning onto my street. It waited until the last minute to move over to the far left lane to turn, wouldn't take advantage of the available gaps in traffic and attempts to stop on this street where traffic is moving at 60+. I take over and drive the rest of the way home, myself.\n\n\nLast night, when my husband got home from work, I told him just how bad FSD is and he wanted to try it that following morning on our Model Y. We figured maybe the better cameras on HW4 would lead to a better experience. That was not the case.\n\nThis morning we went out for a drive to try some of the features out. We had it park in a parallel parking space. It scoped it out, lined itself up and did pretty well pulling into the well-marked space. We then programmed a lunch destination into the nav and hit the stalk to engage the FSD. It immediately puts the blinker on and drives over the curb in front of. This is the same curb it navigated around when backing into this spot, not even 2 minutes before.\n\nWe make our way to our destination. The navigation insisted we take a right and then an immediate left into the restaurant parking lot instead of going straight and turning right into the parking lot. It takes the right turn, crosses into the left lane without signaling and proceeds into the turn lane and shuts down FSD.\n\nThe final straw for us was after leaving the restaurant. Engaged the FSD and it takes us out of the parking lot, turning right. We needed to be in the CLEARLY marked left turn lane following this right turn out of the lot. It pulls into the lane with a straight arrow and turns on the left blinker. Left arrow turns green and the car pulls into the intersection, and attempts to sideswipe a Lexus in the actual turn lane. I disengage and turn it completely off.\n\n\nThe Elon bros are big mad at anyone posting their bad experience. I shared my experience on the Tesla lounge subreddit and was banned not even 5 minutes after. Anyone that criticizes the program is immediately called a bot or a troll. It's so embarrassing for them.\n\nI wanted to share my experience because I am an owner. I think you should be able to take criticism and give it out even if you're a huge fan of something.\n\n My biggest problem with this is that in my opinion, this whole FSD program is a scam. A lot of people have paid upwards of $15,000 for feature that isn't at all what is advertised and marketed. I would never let this program operate without extreme caution and at that point, how can you call it \"Full self driving\"?\n\nElon musk is a conman and a scammer that has been stealing millions from people who still don't have the product they paid for. I do still like my Teslas, but man, this has put a really bad taste in my mouth. ",

They eventually got that sorted, but ever since getting it fixed the car makes an intermittent \"knocking\" noise that sounds similar to a rock hitting the windshield.\n\nI've taken in for service three times to address this issue but they cannot pinpoint it. Their best guess is that it's the HVAC unit causing the noise. Whatever they did last time alleviated the issue for 4 months, but ultimately it's back to being borked, and I'm quickly approaching the limits on Lemon Law in my state.\n\nI have 23k miles on it, so I'm pushing the limits on Lemon Law in my state (WA, 24k miles & less than 2 years of ownership)\n\nI have created another service appointment and I intend to tell them at time of drop off that if it is not resolved I will be lemoning it. I also have many recordings of the noise as proof, even though I have not been able to repro the issue with a tech present.\n\nHas anyone been through this process before that can advise?\n\n",

      "selftext": "I purchased a used 2018 model x 18 months ago.\n\nEverything has been OK initially, I purchased through Tesla and had the used approved warranty etc.\n\n4 weeks ago I started getting an intermittent fault, essentially the car would intermittently be \"stupid\", no cruise control, assist features etc. It would infrequently resolve after 45 minutes idle for the next drive. \n\nThis intermittent issue then extended to critical features like power steering.\n\nNow I don't know if anyone has tried, but it's simply not possible/safe to drive this car without power steering.\n\nAlso, did you know the car can just stop power steering from working randomly? Seems dangerous. Not something you would want to happen while going at speed towards a curving exit ramp.\n\nThe car needed to be put on a flatbed to get it to service.\n\nI'm 2 weeks in, and most recently I've been advised that even if a fault isn't being found, the time it takes will just be added to my bill. This means that an inability to diagnose a fault is placed on me as financial responsibility but I have no power over the tools/processes and no alternative.\n\nI'm appalled by the customer services,  im not blaming the service team they can inly do what they are told to do. I'm without a car for two weeks so far, technically they (Tesla) seem to think they can just keep billing me. In theory the car could be with them for months, I could rack up a bill in excess of the cars worth!\n\nI've had to formally complain just to get a dialogue with someone who might be able to get me a courtesy car instead of one that would cost me each day.\n\nTo say I'm appalled is an understatement. I love the car, but if I have to foot a lengthy bill for diagnostics because the services lack the ability to diagnose faults effectively, then I can't see how this is a viable business to partner with for my travelling needs.\n\nRant over. Love the car but hate pretty much everything else about the way this all works (or doesn't in this instance). \n\nIf I could go back in time I would not have made this purchase.",

      "selftext": "The Musk lawsuit has brought up some interesting questions. Everyone for the most part remembers Karpathy as head of AP/FSD, which he was an early employee of OpenAI who was hired by Musk in 2017: \n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/tesla-hires-deep-learning-expert-andrej-karpathy-to-lead-autopilot-vision/\n\nIt was then shortly thereafter that he - perhaps with an assist by Karpathy - tried to then take over OpenAI to work on Tesla's FSD. If you read the 2/1/2018 email and forwarded attachment it is blacked out who wrote the forwarded email that Musk is referencing, but for it to the credible and the person known to OpenAI, I assume it's Karpathy that wrote the email as it appears to be a Tesla employee (\"we\" when talking about Tesla) plus the forwarded email goes into detail about Google's DeepMind that Karpathy had previously interned there.\n\nhttps://openai.com/blog/openai-elon-musk\n\nI'm very curious on Musk's intent with hiring Karpathy from OpenAI, which he did the hiring, made his play to gain control of OpenAI and then shortly thereafter resigned from OpenAI's board. I also wonder if that was Musk's intent all along with OpenAI in co-founding it as OpenAI's founding aligns approximately to when AP was launched, though that's more speculative.",

The only reason i\u2019m doing it is because I have 6 months free of supercharging plus it\u2019s very quick and convenient. The issue is i\u2019m hearing it is very bad to supercharge a lot but I never charge over 80% and don\u2019t go below 20% so will I be okay if I supercharge basically all the time throughout my ownership because I do live in a Condo without charging stations in our parking garage. Also worried because it\u2019s not an LFP battery. Let me know what has been your experience supercharging all the time, how many miles you have on your car, and how much battery degradation you have seen. Thanks! ",

      "selftext": "An interesting thing I noticed in OpenAI's response to the Elon lawsuit: in private, Musk was telling OpenAI his expectation was FSD in 2-3 years on an accelerated schedule only if OpenAI joined up with Tesla to make it happen, but publicly he was telling customers and investors at SXSW it would be around 1.7 years.\n\n\n\n> From:  Elon Musk <>\n\n> To:  Ilya Sutskever <>, Greg Brockman <>\n\n> Date: Thu, Feb 1, 2018 at 3:52 AM\n\n> Subject: Fwd: Top AI institutions today\n\n>  is exactly right. We may wish it otherwise, but, in my and \u2019s opinion, Tesla is the only path that could even hope to hold a candle to Google. Even then, the probability of being a counterweight to Google is small. It just isn't zero.\n\n> Begin forwarded message:\n\n> From:   <>\n\n> To:  Elon Musk <>\n\n> Date: January 31, 2018 at 11:54:30 PM PST\n\n> Subject: Re: Top AI institutions today\n\n> Working at the cutting edge of AI is unfortunately expensive. For example,In addition to DeepMind, Google also has Google Brain, Research, and Cloud. And TensorFlow, TPUs, and they own about a third of all research (in fact, they hold their own AI conferences).\n>\n> I also strongly suspect that compute horsepower will be necessary (and possibly even sufficient) to reach AGI. If historical trends are any indication, progress in AI is primarily driven by systems - compute, data, infrastructure. The core algorithms we use today have remained largely unchanged from the ~90s. Not only that, but any algorithmic advances published in a paper somewhere can be almost immediately re-implemented and incorporated. Conversely, algorithmic advances alone are inert without the scale to also make them scary.\n>\n> It seems to me that OpenAI today is burning cash and that the funding model cannot reach the scale to seriously compete with Google (an 800B company). If you can't seriously compete but continue to do research in open, you might in fact be making things worse and helping them out \u201cfor free\u201d, because any advances are fairly easy for them to copy and immediately incorporate, at scale.\n>\n> A for-profit pivot might create a more sustainable revenue stream over time and would, with the current team, likely bring in a lot of investment. However, building out a product from scratch would steal focus from AI research, it would take a long time and it's unclear if a company could \u201ccatch up\u201d to Google scale, and the investors might exert too much pressure in the wrong directions.The most promising option I can think of, as I mentioned earlier, would be for OpenAI to attach to Tesla as its cash cow. I believe attachments to other large suspects (e.g. Apple? Amazon?) would fail due to an incompatible company DNA. Using a rocket analogy, Tesla already built the \u201cfirst stage\u201d of the rocket with the whole supply chain of Model 3 and its onboard computer and a persistent internet connection. The \u201csecond stage\u201d would be a full self driving solution based on large-scale neural network training, which OpenAI expertise could significantly help accelerate. With a functioning full self-driving solution in ~2-3 years we could sell a lot of cars/trucks. If we do this really well, the transportation industry is large enough that we could increase Tesla's market cap to high O(~100K), and use that revenue to fund the AI work at the appropriate scale.\n>\n> I cannot see anything else that has the potential to reach sustainable Google-scale capital within a decade.\n\nSource: https://openai.com/blog/openai-elon-musk\n\n\nTo the public as SXSW one month later, with no deal with OpenAI, he said less than two years:\n\n\"I think probably by end of next year [end of 2019] self-driving will encompass essentially all modes of driving and be at least 100% to 200% safer than a person.\" March 2018 to Dec. 2019 would be around 21 months, without a commitment from OpenAI. No commitment for the thing that he privately said was supposed to put things on an accelerated schedule to 2-3 years.",

      "selftext": "I\u2019m doing the research for buying my first electric car and the more I look into it, the more it seems obvious to me that Tesla cars were designed with American roads in mind, not European ones\n\n*I first looked at the Model 3. They have no stalks to enable the turn signals anymore. Using the on-wheel buttons is impossible in the middle of a roundabout.\n\n*Gotta size up to the Model Y then, the only model still featuring stalks. Let\u2019s see how it performs doing a U-turn in a narrow European street, or in tight European parking spaces: the turning radius is an absolutely massive 12.1 m. An ID4 can do it in 10.2m and a Renault M\u00e9gane E-Tech in 10.4m. \u201cYeah that isn\u2019t great\u201d you might argue but \u201cyou do have parking sensors to help you, right\u201d? Well no actually, Tesla removed the ultrasonic parking sensors to save costs and relies exclusively on the cameras nowadays (Tesla \u201cVision\u201d). The results are predictably terribly unreliable.\n\nAm I missing something? Yes the driving range is pretty impressive for the price, but it doesn\u2019t seem terribly practical for day to day living.",

      "selftext": "I bought my 2015 p90d Ms about a year ago as an avid wide eyed Tesla supporter. Hardly two months into ownership my driver side front suspension went out. I took it in to my dallas Tesla service center who said the cost would be $1800! I was pretty shocked at the price considering I just purchased the vehicle, but \"I guess this is the price I pay for choosing to buy out of warranty, how much worse can it get\".. well it can get a lot worse honestly. To continue, Tesla repaired the suspension and a few more months go by and one of my tires goes flat so I call Tesla who assures me they will arrive in 2 hours. Mind you I have just worked 12 hours in a warehouse and I am exhausted with a friendly co worker who is courteously waiting with me. The 2 hours pass and I call back for an update. At this time the roadside representative tells me no one can make it out within the next 48 hours! I tell the representative it is pretty cold out and my battery is draining and I have been waiting 2 hours already and this is not acceptable. Begrudgingly she admits fault and sends me a \"loner tire\". I go buy 4 new tires from a local discount tire for $2200. I continue my Tesla experience for a couple more months when I hit a pot hole that blows out my driver side tire and peels off my front under carriage \"aero shield\". Naturally I tow the car to the Tesla service center for assessment.  They begin to tell me they can't work on my car because I have to buy a tire with them.. but my tire is warranted.. but they can't get the vehicle in the shop unless I buy a new tire.. $600. So I guess I'm buying a tire.. next they quote $5600 to replace aeroshield, right suspension, tire, and other under carriage parts damaged from the \"impact\". At this point I'm considering filing insurance claim but decide to just foot the bill and forego the increase in premium. Approved. A day later the app shows a second approval request for $5700, odd I think. Maybe they made a mistake, it's just $100 don't make a big deal, Approved. A day later I receive a call \"your parts will be delayed would you like a loaner\". \"Of course\" so I head in after work. When I arrive I'm told to go into the app to accept terms for the loaner where I see ANOTHER quote approval request, this time its $10,100!! I immediately request an itemized explanation. \"You need an alignment and other suspension work or it may start to make noise\". I explain I'm losing trust, I see a $900 air compressor in the list and I know my compressor was working at the time of delivery to the shop. I explain I just want the absolutely necessary work done, we eventually get back to $5,800. Approved. 1.5 days go by and I receive a call \" we found damage to your steering column, it will add $4,000 to the repair for a total of 10,400\". At this point I file a claim with my insurance and inform Tesla of my plan to have them work with the insurance firm. When I tell the Tesla rep about the insurance he admits that the majority of the damage is \"collision damage\" but they are not the collision department and therefore do not work with insurance. At this time I am told I should prepare to remove my vehicle from the property within 72 hours \"this is a favor since it is the weekend\" and I would have pictures of damage sent to me so I could share them with my insurance adjusters. Why work on the car, why not send it next door to collision. Advise the consumer support the customer isn't that what customer service is?  I bought the car for 31k, and within a year I put $2200 in tires, $1800 in suspension, and now I've been quoted 10,400 in new repairs. That's nearly 15k and with 160k miles who knows if the battery goes next.  It's sad to say I have lost faith in the brand, the service has not been on par with the cost of the vehicle. I would not advise buying Tesla.. especially out of warranty.. lease if you want the experience. This has felt like a cash grab and extortion, worst PURCHASE decision ever! ",

The PCS and some thermal tube replaced. No less than 5 days later the car wouldn't turn on. I literally had just driven it on an errand and came home to put groceries in the fridge. I was then going to go out to buy something else and of course it does not power on. This time when roadside assistance came the vehicle could not be started. It was towed to Tesla.  \n\n\nThese kind of problems are absolutely unacceptable in a 50k+ vehicle. This vehicle doesn't even have 3500 miles on it and I've only owned it for 6 months.

      "selftext": "An apparent VIN entry error (or fraud) has led to my Tesla having Supercharging disabled. A salvage title on my VIN, which is clearly not my car because I'm still driving it, caused this. It seems that Tesla could look into all of the electronic records and see that my car has not been in a serious accident, and has charged nearly every day, but the VIN shows up so that's good enough for them. They want to charge nearly $900 for an inspection to re-enable charging, but I'm assuming that the warranty will still be invalid. I'm still in the process of figuring out what happened and police are investigating. I hope this has a good ending but is a real hassle now.\n\nUPDATE 3/13/24\n\nAfter getting 2 state BMVs to investigate, the insurance auction company states that the VIN on their car windshield matches mine, but the computer in the car has the last number as different. They claim that the original VIN plate was damaged and replaced so it must have been an error during that process. They say they have never fixed an error like this in the system before so it still shows as salvage. They claim to be working on it. However the state has at least returned the title to my ownership.",

      "selftext": "I bought a brand-new Tesla model Y I waited a long time to do this purchase and eventually I excitedly made the move. Yes, it is high tech vehicle, and it presents any new owner with a steep learning curve. There are a million little details, that I\u2019ve discovered, and I am still discovering, which I truly enjoy, thus I shan\u2019t be mentioning what we all like.\n\nHowever, I shall mention the \u201cwhat I do not like\u201d:\n\n1. Regen braking: as sophisticated as this car is, there is no way to remove this feature? Something like 100%, 66%, 33% and 0% regen brake options, at least? I understand that the range changes, and I would be more than copacetic with a disclaimer, advising me of the newly reduced range, once I downgrade the regen braking. Not having the options is rubbing me the wrong way: it is akin with having Musk on the back seat, pulling strings as I drive. Not cool, mate, not cool at all! It gets even more bothersome, when I drive my wife\u2019s ID4. That car \u201cglides\u201d once I remove my foot off the acceleration. Or even my previous Chevy Volt, that somehow still had some regen feature even without braking, as I was coasting. So please, someone change this gestapo stile of extreme regen forced on Tesla drivers.\n2. The wheels!!! Why must the rim of the wheels be outside the tire? I know about the aerodynamics, dynamics of fluids, and all that jazz, but really for a few additional miles, must I drive around with choppy wheels? Not to ask the obvious question: all that research didn\u2019t come with a smarter design than this almost roman war chariot?\n3. Suspension: let us agree \u2013 it is horrible! Stock Tesla suspension is not coffee mug friendly. If you put your mug in the cup holders, make sure it is well closed, or coffee will be shaken and stirred to the point where it\u2019ll project itself outside the cup, through the small sipping opening. I was expecting a suspension at least as good if not better than a Mercedes: it is a Tesla after all \u2013 the poor man\u2019s Rolls Royce!  \n\n\nNote to all that seem to miss the intention of this post: My main complaint is that I am forced to \"learn\" to drive this very smart electic vehicle. The issue I am having is that I do not want to learn a new driving style, but, it the car is that smart, I want to be given the option of having the car learn me! I want the options of me choosing what and how!",

      "selftext": "I have a 2018 model 3 performance with 67k miles, car is wrapped from day 1 so it's nearly perfect.  Several times in the last 6 years I would have traded into another car if they would just let me keep the lifetime free supercharging and FSD that is still in beta (no way I'm paying for it twice).  \n\nLast week I found out they're offering transfers of both FSD and free supercharging if you take delivery of another car by end of March.  So using their trade in estimator, they came back with 18,400.  Seemed to be a little low at first but it still made sense for me because on a new model Y I'd be cutting a check for roughly 23k after tax credit.  About the same as a new base model Civic, so it seemed like a no brainer.  I placed the order.\n\nThis morning, they sent me a revised trade in offer at 10,300.  No explanation why they were so far off, no responses to emails, nothing.  So it seems like instead of \"transferring\" the FSD and free supercharging, they're just taking it off the trade in.  That's a scam on top of the already existing scam that I paid for FSD 6 years ago and still don't have anything close.\n\nNow, I get that I could sell the car on the open market and probably get close to double that offer.  Their pricing and valuation methods are basically akin to the NFT market.  They've taken a neutral/positive leaning customer and turned me into the biggest anti-Tesla person I know.  I have to own my 6 year old stupidity now and who enjoys doing that?",

      "selftext": "Having watched Tesla violate environmental laws with effective impunity at its Fremont factory since 2019, I figured it was time to collect all the evidence into one place. Between the growing air pollution problem (76 Clean Air Act violations in 2023!), the recent dumping scandal, and some new documents I found detailing shocking groundwater pollution levels at the factory, it's an ugly picture. As far as I can tell Tesla is now one of the most prolific corporate polluters in California, if not the country, there's literally an elementary school next door, and yet nobody seems to be reporting on the situation. I hope that getting all this research into one place will help with that, but at this point it's hard to expect much to be done about it.\n\n[https://niedermeyer.io/2024/02/02/its-the-impunity-stupid/](https://niedermeyer.io/2024/02/02/its-the-impunity-stupid/)",

She had it towed to Tesla who said that it was the 12v battery again, upon replacing the battery they said the big battery pack wouldn't run through self tests and it would need to be replaced.  Value of the car according to KBB is $9000, the battery replacement would cost approx 14.5k just for the battery, not including the labor to replace it.\n\nShe's trading it in (getting $2600 on trade) for a standard gas Civic, she said she'll never own another electric car.\n\nThis past week I was at the NADA show (as an exhibitor) while all this was going on at home.  I spoke to a few people there who feel the same way, the fact that EVs basically have a HUGE end of battery-life replacement cost will ultimately kill the market when people realize that it's not just as \"cost effective\" as replacing a timing belt or transmission, basically the cost of the new battery pack is equal to the cost of an entire vehicle (granted likely not the same overall value, but one could argue that the fit and finish on some of the Teslas is on par with the Civic she purchased.",

I dont drive fast, we live close to Liverpool, got a house, wife, kids and a dog.\n\nRecently I was given an option to get myself an EV on a salary sacrifice scheme and I found that Model 3 and Model Y are quite good in terms of value-for-money on those schemes.\n\nSo here I am asking:\n\nThe scheme is worth it anyway, but are Teslas worth it? There is a lot of hate, somewhat similar to how iPhones are, so that its just a featurebox, way overpriced and limiting more than enabling, unless you're good with basic tasks.\n\nDo they break often? Are they reliable? Does 270 mile charge really mean that or is it only on a straight road when its sunny, otherwise its 150 and you have to charge it twice a week? Is it hard to get them serviced? Any other issues that are worth mentioning?\n\nThanks to whoever responds.",

      "selftext": "Hey guys I wanted to share my 1 year experience of owning a 2023 Tesla Model Y Performance. \n\nTL;DR the product is brilliant but the execution is very poor. Would not ever purchase again. \n\nI purchased my car in March 2023. It was a little over $67k (includes tax, license & fees). I currently have 33,000 miles on it.\n\nI have taken this car every where, and driven it in extreme temperatures. Here are my thoughts below: \n\nPros: \n\n1. Amazing supercharger network. Second to none. I can always count on finding a charger along my route that works, even in the most rural areas. \n2. Very easy to drive. As a person obsessed with buttons I was concerned how I was going to transition to a touch screen only and a very minimalist design. The only way I can describe it is like switching from a blackberry to an iPhone. This includes one pedal driving. Once you get used to it, it\u2019s hard to go back. You also realize all the unnecessary distractions found in most cars. \n3. Software is amazing. Perhaps the best I have seen in any car manufacturer. I believe Tesla can get away without offering Apple CarPlay or Android Auto due to how good their software is. Pretty cool that you can get over the air updates and unlock or improve features in the car. \n4. Performance is amazing. This car has almost 500 hp, AWD, and gets 0-60 in 3.5 seconds. To stay it\u2019s stupid fast is an understatement. \n5. Love all the accessories I can buy for the car to make it more personalized to me, and or improve the ride in general. \n\nCons: \n\n1. Poor build quality & quality control. I\u2019m talking about misaligned doors, body panels, interior pieces not put together properly or easily fall apart (sunshade not be able to hold a garage remote without major wear or tear). If you have attention to detail stay far away. Makes me wonder if these are the things I see, then what other very important quality issues that may involve the suspension, control arms or battery that I don\u2019t not see? \n2. Highly inflated EPA range. This car is rated to go 303 miles on a single charge. However what they don\u2019t tell you is the fine print which reads, *going 55 mph, no wind resistance, a/c, or extra weight. Most I have ever gotten going 84 mph cruise control in the AZ heat was 225 miles. \n3. Horrible customer service. There isn\u2019t anyone you can call. Everything has to be done in the Tesla app. You send a message or email and wait to hear back. Also service centers are filled with incompetent people. This isn\u2019t just a single service center. I have been to various ones my state. They are all bad. I swear you take the car for one thing and they break two other things in the process. \n4. Though the performance for the model Y is amazing the turn radius is horrible. My car has a turn radius of a bus. \n5. The depreciation is real. You will lose lots of money in the first year alone. Don\u2019t ever buy. Only lease if you insist on driving an EV. \n6. Battery degradation is real. You\u2019re fucked if you buy new or used and exceed 100,000 miles if you drive a lot like me once warranty is gone. \n7. Because this car relies on technology and cameras so much, a problem with camera (being blocked or turned off due to rain for example) can lead to disabling cruise control, park assist, 360 camera and auto pilot which in my opinion is a flaw in its design. \n\nFeel free to ask me any questions, and I would be more than happy to honestly answer or expand on any points I mentioned.",

This is a 2022 Model S Plaid and the smell started to get noticeable after 9 months, Tesla jerked me around for almost 3 months saying just to run the HVAC at MAX Heat for 30 minutes every week which of course helps to dry the filters but when it rains again the smell is back. finally they did the HEPA filter but at my own expense. \n\nSo for those who keep track of the gas savings. add that $440 charge yearly to fix the smell after the rainy season every year.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ii3t69k99ffc1.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11c587f6096e274401ed3200549aa82ddbead9cc\n\n&#x200B;\n\n ",

Given this is approaching the lifespan of a typically driven car, at what point do you have a right to claim fraud?\n\n\nI will say this is not a situation I've found myself in personally. But if I where I feel as though I would geniunley be angry about it.\n\nI understand the technology simply isn't there yet, and they cant give you what doesnt exist.\n\nBut I also understand they where sold under the pretense that it would be coming very soon.\n\nHas the company offered any reasonable compensation to offset their early adopters?",

The story is this:\n\nCar (2022 Model Y) was in for a service. Afterwards, the car is taken for a test drive. The recuperation is turned off by a Tesla employee, i.e. only the actual brakes decelerate the car. The car is taken on the Autobahn (everything takes place near Munich in Germany). The car is accelerated to highway speeds around 20 times, followed by sharp breaking each time. It starts to smell like something was burned. The brake discs show a strong discoloration afterwards.\n\nMy client now claims that this is because the car was never made for being used without recuperation. The brakes are not sufficient to be used on their own without deceleration.\n\nDoes this make sense to you? Do you have any experience how the brake discs behave on a Model Y without recuperation?\n\nThanks in advance.",

Got my money back today.\n\n\\-\n\nPurchased EAP thinking I'd be receiving the entire feature-set for the purchase when I realized most of the advertised features (auto-parking, summon, etc.) were unavailable for my vehicle. I missed the refund window as I contacted the wrong department. I noticed there wasn't a lot of information online regarding successful disputes / refunds, and Tesla support had little information.\n\nI lost a credit card dispute to Airbnb a while back, and this card issuer ruled in their favour. Airbnb had put together a massive document outlining why I'm a massive idiot, but reading that taught me what dispute departments must be looking for.\n\nWith that, I cobbled together a big PDF document outlining the changes that Tesla had made to their wording on their official website (with historical archives), the purchase flow for the software upgrade, the barriers Tesla has put up when it comes to contacting their support, communications between Tesla and I, and a lot of contextual information. This morning it was settled in my favour. Confirmed this with the card issuer because the wording on the email was a little unclear.\n\nJust wanted to post this win, and to anyone else that may be researching the topics of disputing software upgrades from Tesla.",

Then I had to sort out some things I had on the passenger seat. Luckily I noticed that the trees were moving and was shocked to discover the car was in neutral and in the process of rolling down the hill! The car was heading straight for a pedestrian behind the car. Very much could have ended in disaster.\n\nI take full responsibility for the lapse in concentration but I'm wondering if the design can be improved such that you don't have to skip over Neutral every time you switch between Drive and Reverse.\n\nOne of the reasons I became complacent was because in Drive, Reverse and Park, Tesla's don't move (unlike ICE vehicles which will creep forward when in Drive).\n\nWhen is Neutral really used apart from at a car wash or when driving onto a Tow Truck?\n\nWould it be a better design to have a big warning appear with an ok / cancel button on the touchscreen whenever you switch to neutral?\n\n  \nEdit: Adjusted to mention Reverse rather than Park.",

Notice that the front panel is missing, and that the air suspension is sunken. I mentioned this in the previous post, and some Tesla stans would use the old \"lie\", \"FUD\" or \"you never owned a Tesla\" (I did for years) cope. Notice how the car looks similar to the car in my previous post, with the same \"signature marks\" of a battery failure. \n\nIf the HV battery dies, the 12V battery gradually drains, and the car can no longer balance the suspension. To open the car and set it into tow mode, the 12V battery needs to be charged, and the only way to do that, is to remove the front panel.",

The Norwegian Public Roads Administration is looking into reports of an unusually high number of control arm failures in Models S and X. Right now they're assessing the risk a broken control arm could pose to safety, and whether said risk warrants a recall.\n\nTesla themselves say it's very rare, mostly happens to cars that have seen significant use (100.000 km and up) and also that a broken control arm doesn't pose any safety risk anyway.

Demo car in Tesla inventory with around 2k miles, but listed as new, warranty: October 2027 / 80,000 kilometers in total & October 2031 / 160,000 kilometers in totalSo effectively those get 1 year less warranty (vs 4y & 8y) but warranty mileage is the same and they cost 42000 CHF (with no delivery fee added AFAIK)\n2. New from inventory 44000 CHF (no delivery fee added AFAIK)\n3. New order 46000 CHF to which you add 1000 CHF delivery\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy confusion is mostly for demo cars with some miles on them but listed as new:\n\nA. Do they still come with the 7 days or 150km (whichever comes first) to report any factory defects, even if they are demo cars\n\nB. Do demo cars listed as new, come as pristine as the new cars? e.g. if I find curb rash or serious dents or scratches on the demo car I buy, is it just my luck or can these be fixed under warranty?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking forward to know from others that bought demo cars from Tesla (preferably from Europe) with some miles on them, how was their car warranty and coverage any different from a new car from inventory? Did the car have any scratches from misuse or manufacturing defects? Do those get fixed by Tesla?",

      "selftext": "Hey guys.\n\nI've had an absolute nightmare of an experience with a new Model YP that I bought in October 5th 2023. Unfortunately.. fell to the bait of the unfounded hype around Tesla, it also made sense from a tax rebate standpoint.\n\nAnyways, upon pickup, I had a rear headliner scratch that they promised to fix. I thought this would be straightforward.  Well, it has turned into a nightmare. 3+ months later and this has morphed into black stains (oil from SC personnel), damaged + scratched trim everywhere from the rear to the literally the front airbag trim, incorrectly installed trim (bent corners, misaligned trim), and the icing on the cake was literally a broken seat-belt holder (which compromised the safety of the passenger seat for 2 weeks) at one point...  Fast forward to this past week, and after another 2 days in the SC, more black stains, corner damage, scratches on the headliner, incorrectly installed trim, etc. with seemingly no end in sight and more damage each time.\n\nSo my question is... has anyone exercised the Lemon law? I think I've had 5 visits to my SC and this upcoming one will be my 6th. If I had known, I would have never taken it in for a rear headliner scratch but this is crazy and I want out. Has anyone gone through this process? Can I avoid getting a lawyer for this?\n\nI know part of the Cali Lemon Law is that a reasonable number of attempts need to be made (2+) and I'm going to be on my 6th next week for the same exact issue but the \"manager\" I talked to said Lemon Laws are only for when the safety is compromised which I stated that with my front passenger seat not being able to have a functioning seat belt, it was compromised. He claims to have never had a Lemon Law be approved for this.\n\n**TL;DR rear headliner scratch on delivery day has resulted in a nightmare of 3+ months of service and my upcoming 6th visit to address a headliner scratch that continues to result in practically every other part of the headliner getting damaged. Is it time to exercise the Lemon Law? Any experience with how it goes? Any associated costs?**\n\nEdit: Found this link to tag onto it [https://www.dca.ca.gov/acp/pdf\\_files/lemonlaw\\_qa.pdf](https://www.dca.ca.gov/acp/pdf_files/lemonlaw_qa.pdf)  \nMy understanding is that Tesla has it's own arbitration (as per the California Lemon Law). Let me know if anyone has gone through it.  \n",

      "selftext": "If you\u2019re reading this, it means I\u2019ve sold my Tesla. The new buyer wanted a pre-purchase inspection report from Tesla. Funny enough, he could not book this himself. I had to do it through my Tesla App. It cost 250.52$ CAD. My vehicle is a 2022 Model 3 still under original warranty. How bad could it be?\n\nI drove the vehicle in, gave it to the service people\u2026 and they promptly asked me for my driver\u2019s license for a loaner\u2026 \n\nIt seems my Model 3 needs suspension work but no worries and no charge because it\u2019s all covered under the Tesla warranty! Hooray! Well, \u201csuspension work\u201d took all day, from 8h00 AM until 17h00. They even did an alignment! Great, at least it\u2019s all sorted now, right? Wrong! \n\nAt 17h00 I arrive to pick up my car : the advisor tells me it\u2019s outside. I get to it and\u2026 the car is doing an update! The duckers have just pressed update now, right before telling me to pick it up! It took a good 30 minutes to do the update in the parking lot. I finally get in and drive off\u2026 right away, the car pulls badly to the right. The service center is already closed so nothing else to do but return in the morning. \n\nNext day they send a technician to do a test drive with me and he concludes that it indeed pulls to the right. Then he sheepishly tells me, and I kid you not - that \u201ctheir alignment machine has a problem and is not properly calibrated.\u201d WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING ALIGNMENTS THEN? And... they try to align it again!  I don\u2019t know how they do it but this time it\u2019s much better but not perfect by any means. The technician does another test drive and says it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not convinced and demand politely but firmly to schedule me at another service location. This is all happening December 31st. They schedule me for January 4th at another location\u2026\n\nJanuary 4th I arrive there and\u2026 they want to do a test drive. They do it and the tech says \u201cnothing wrong.\u201d At that point I pretty much force them to put it on the machine. They find that the alignment is indeed off! They sheepishly do the work (I waited for 2 hours) and finally give me my car. I ask them for the alignment sheet but they tell me they can\u2019t give it as it\u2019s only \u201cfor internal use.\u201d So after 3 alignments on this car, the only alignment sheet I have is the original one from the 1st shitty alignment. Everything else is \u201cinternal use.\u201d At best it feels like incompetence at worst it feels like a cover-up.\n\nAll I can show for this level of fuckery and the hours wasted is 2 invoices from the Tesla app with \u201c0 amount to pay\u201d and \u201c4 wheel alignment done, slight adjustment was needed.\u201d \n\nBut that\u2019s not even the part the pissed me off. What truly annoyed me was the fact that if I hadn\u2019t done this \u201cinspection\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure they wouldn\u2019t have done any kind of warranty suspension work. Then one day, long after main warranty is expired, you would go to them with a different issue, they would \u201cdiscover\u201d this suspension situation and I\u2019m almost 100% sure you would be forced to pay out of pocket for the remedy. \n\nWhen my 2015 Ford Explorer had a suspension problem (recall), I got a nice letter home informing me to take my car to the dealer. DISCLAIMER: I HATE DEALER HAGGLING AND RIP-OFFS WITH A PASSION.\n\nOn this situation I feel cheated, like they put safety behind a paywall. \n\nAlso know that it\u2019s almost impossible to speak to service people over the phone. You just get the automated message telling you to use the Tesla app. Guys, I love computers but screw this app only nonsense. Sometimes I just want to talk to a human being to ask my stupid question.  For example, there is no \u201cpre-purchase\u201d inspection option in the Tesla Service App. (The \u201cinspection\u201d option is an emission / provincial thing.) You have to do service -> Other -> then write pre-purchase inspection manually. Ridiculous.  And for 250.52$ you get a really shitty pdf without what they really inspected. I would have loved for them to write in big bold letters somewhere : INSPECTED MAIN BATTERY AND MOTOR ALL GOOD. Nope. You don\u2019t get that. It\u2019s a scam.\n\nI\u2019m happy my Model 3 is gone! Screw this user experience.\n\nI will only come back to the brand once Musk is gone. \n\nNow hear me out: I took all this time to bash Tesla because I love the idea of EV cars and strongly wish the company would do better. I\u2019ve always thought about Tesla as the Macintosh of the automotive industry.\n\nThese cars could have been truly AWESOME. The battery, motor and even heat pump  tech are top notch. The supercharger network is amazing and a joy to use. Love sentry mode, the big screen for watching movies on a road trip or while waiting in town and the acceleration / power for an affordable price.\n\nI hate, hate the stupid frameless windows (which freeze in the winter when you park in the street), the lack of CarPlay or at least true google maps, the shitty bluetooth, and some of the touch screen-only car functions (hidden passenger heated seat option, climate control dial right bellow music track), forced auto wipers while on autopilot and the shitty turn signal stalk that always resets to center.\n\nFinally, I hate the dependancy on Tesla for advanced and basic service (see tire alignment). I also hate their arrogance and intensely dislike their dumbass of a CEO. I\u2019m pretty sure all the stuff I hate in my Tesla goes back to him in a way or another. Elon Musk is definitely no Steve Jobs. \n\nThis is my opinion strictly and your experience may differ. \n\nHappy new 2024!",

      "selftext": "There are some serious problems for Elon and company regarding the semi-truck charger.  I have figured out why the price of the truck and the charging data have been very much avoided by Tesla as a whole.  Here are the issues:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Issue #1:\u00a0 The .07 cents per kWh claim.**\n\nWhat Elon did here was take the medium general service rates from Pacific Power, and other regional utilities and averaged them out together.\u00a0 Under medium general service, the power rate is in fact .07 cents per kWh.\u00a0 However, what he is leaving out are the electrical demand charges, and how they are billed, but that depends on the setup you have to charge, that being grid power only, or with the Tesla \"charger pack\", which is conveniently avoided in the math.\u00a0 In fact, the entire infrastructure of power and charging questions are being avoided.\u00a0 *Electrek EV News* went to the Tesla Semi-Truck event on December 3, 2022 (a private invite only event) with two simple questions:\u00a0 What is the cost of the semi-truck, and what is the payload capacity?\u00a0 He never got an answer on either question and for good reason:\u00a0 These questions, if answered honestly, would wreck the math/cost model that Elon has given to the public and investors.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Issue # 2:\u00a0 The \"charging pack\" costs, and grid connect costs with demand charges.**\n\nOnly very recently has the cost of the semi-truck been announced.\u00a0 Tesla claims that it will be between $150,000 and $180,000, probably depending on the battery pack.\u00a0 From what I understand, there is a 300-mile truck, and a 500-mile truck battery.\u00a0 This might explain the difference of the two costs.\u00a0 Still, questions on the charging infrastructure are not answered.\u00a0 I did find a YouTuber that has an EV channel, and he went to the Baker, CA charging site where the first semi-truck charger was installed.\u00a0\n\nHe learned from boots on the ground there that Tesla initially tried to connect the charger direct to the grid power, and Pacific Power said, \"no way\".\u00a0 \u00a0Tesla then came back with the \"charging pack\", which is a massive battery bank and only then would Pacific Power allow the charger to be installed.\u00a0 The \"charging pack\" battery bank is about the size of a large shipping container.\u00a0 Based on my research, and what I know about battery costs, the \"charging pack\" would be around $500,000 and would be able to charge two trucks at the same time.\u00a0 This is a process called \"load shedding\", and the only way you could possibly avoid electrical demand charges from Pacific Power, and the only way Pacific Power could handle it.\u00a0\n\nSo, Tesla semi-truck buyers are about to find out what's inside the fortune cookies that Tesla is handing out:\u00a0 You buy the massive \"charging pack\" battery (Tesla is way behind building batteries, and is currently purchasing them from Panasonic) or, you go straight grid connect and get hit with mind boggling demand charges, if the utility will allow it.\u00a0 This is where the $15,500 per month number comes from in demand costs from Pacific Power.\u00a0 There is another option to \"trickle charge\" the semi-truck, but that would take 20 hours to do that.\u00a0 20-hour charging does not work on any profitable trucking business model whatsoever.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Issue #3:\u00a0 The Tesla semi-truck\u00a0mileage range, and charging does not match current trucking framework.**\n\nI have personally spoken with many truck drivers and asked them what they thought of the Tesla semi-truck.\u00a0 Just about every response has been identical.\u00a0 It's a laugh, shaking of the head and a comment starting out like \"... it's completely ridiculous.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOut of 24 hours in the day or night, OTR truckers are allowed to drive for 11 hours, if they take a 30 min break somewhere within the 11 hours.\u00a0 Most drivers go 5 hours, stop and get fuel and eat, then hit the road for the next 6 hours.\u00a0 A trucker who keeps up on the interstate at 70 mph, might cover 700 miles in one day.\u00a0 That pays really well.\u00a0 Under the Tesla semi model, this wrecks the trucker's income because of the range issues.\u00a0 Tesla's claims of 30 min charging come from them researching the trucker driving model, not the reality of actually charging.\u00a0 They are dishing out the doctored math, so it makes sense to truckers.\u00a0\n\nThe problem is a 30 min charge can only happen under a mega-watt of power consumption.\u00a0 There is no charging infrastructure for the truckers right now, so none of them would be onboard.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, what truck stop is going to take on the $15k per month demand and hope that Tesla semis come to charge?\u00a0 And what will the charging cost the truckers?\u00a0 That number is completely unknown.\u00a0 How many of you prefer \"unknown costs\" when trying to build a business model?\u00a0\n\nWhat are the costs to build out the \"charging pack\" system?  No answers from Tesla whatsoever.\n\nCar & Driver did a review of the semi-truck and conveniently avoided the costs of charging.\n\nHmmm.  Who paid them to do the review?   Show me any vehicle, plane, boat company that builds something and doesn't share the fuel costs/per mile/per whatever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Issue #4:\u00a0 Battery degradation, and the deceptions of Tesla's unsustainable \"charging packs\":**\n\nI have researched battery degradation, and it looks bad for Tesla.\u00a0 Mega-watt charging is really hard on rechargeable batteries, and it shortens the life of them significantly.\u00a0 Here I have a graph from a NREL source on the degradation:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t3e804syx3bc1.jpg?width=697&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22d538d895001072927c264734ccf4d57e26c0b4\n\nAs anyone can see, the degradation is severe even at two charges per and over 1.5 years, and just like how the A-B-C trucking model requires.\u00a0 Truckers will want to use the :30 min break to recharge but will require a mega-watt charger.\u00a0 This model is not sustainable replacing a $500k \"charger pack\" battery bank every two years.\u00a0 Not to mention the truck battery itself.\u00a0\n\nI believe the real cost of the Tesla semi-truck is around $800,000 in any model grid connected or \"charging pack\" connected.\u00a0 The monthly break down could be around $30,000 per month to own the Tesla semi for just one year if you grid connected the mega-watt charger.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPlease explain how the Tesla model makes any sense.  And I get it that the A-B-A trucking model is what they started out with (day cab trucks), but they are already pushing this \"convoy\" idea on to investors and the public.  None of this is realistic.\n\nMoreover, Elon is now claiming that the trucks can be charged with \"solar\".  This is totally insane.\n\nA mega-watt of solar is at the peak of the day, full sun given 100 watt/meter square is:\n\n130,680 meter squared. (about 3 acres)\n\nWith ground installs starting at $2.33-$2.88 per watt, the solar costs alone are around $2.5 million.\n\nThen add the \"charging pack\", also add the electrical infrastructure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWho is paying for this?\n\nIn 15,000 years of history, fraud and stupidity have never worked out.  Thanks, Elon, for another mass deception.  The investors and SEC will rip your eyes out of your head over this one.\n\nI predict that Panasonic in the end will leave a dirty condom hanging out of your ass as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Cyber Truck is an equally charging disaster.\n\nMore on that later.",

They\u2019re an expression of his creativity. Or the result of his mental-health challenges. Or fallout from his stress, or sleep deprivation.\n\nIn recent years, some executives and board members at his companies and others close to the billionaire have developed a persistent concern that there is another component driving his behavior: his use of drugs. \n\nAnd they fear the Tesla TSLA 0.73%increase; green up pointing triangle and SpaceX chief executive\u2019s drug use could have major consequences not just for his health, but also the six companies and billions in assets he oversees, according to people familiar with Musk and the companies.\n\nThe world\u2019s wealthiest person has used LSD, cocaine, ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms, often at private parties around the world, where attendees sign nondisclosure agreements or give up their phones to enter, according to people who have witnessed his drug use and others with knowledge of it. Musk has previously smoked marijuana in public and has said he has a prescription for the psychedelic-like ketamine. \n\nIn 2018, for example, he took multiple tabs of acid at a party he hosted in Los Angeles. The next year he partied on magic mushrooms at an event in Mexico. In 2021, he took ketamine recreationally with his brother, Kimbal Musk, in Miami at a house party during Art Basel. He has taken illegal drugs with current SpaceX and former Tesla board member Steve Jurvetson.\n\nPeople close to Musk, who is now 52, said his drug use is ongoing, especially his consumption of ketamine, and that they are concerned it could cause a health crisis. Even if it doesn\u2019t, it could damage his businesses.\n\nIllegal drug use would likely be a violation of federal policies that could jeopardize SpaceX\u2019s billions of dollars in government contracts. Musk is intrinsic to the value of his companies, potentially putting at risk around $1 trillion in assets held by investors, tens of thousands of jobs and big parts of the U.S. space program.\n\nSpaceX is the only U.S. company now approved to transport NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station. The Pentagon, meanwhile, has stepped up purchases of SpaceX rocket launches in recent years, and the company has also been looking to develop a large business selling satellite services to national-security agencies.\n\nOne former Tesla director, Linda Johnson Rice, grew so frustrated with Musk\u2019s volatile behavior and her concerns about his drug consumption that she didn\u2019t stand for re-election to the electric-car company\u2019s board in 2019, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\n\nTop, Linda Johnson Rice, a former Tesla director, in 2019. Below, Gwynne Shotwell, president of SpaceX, in 2015. PHOTO: ALEXANDER TAMARGO/GETTY IMAGES FOR COLORCOMM, BRETT COOMER/HOUSTON CHRONICLE/GETTY IMAGES\nMusk didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. \n\nAn attorney for Musk, Alex Spiro, said that Musk is \u201cregularly and randomly drug tested at SpaceX and has never failed a test.\u201d Spiro, who said he represents Tesla, added in response to detailed questions that \u201cthere are other false facts\u201d in this article but didn\u2019t detail them.\n\nThe people around Musk long ago became accustomed to his volatile behavior. Some SpaceX executives who had long worked with him, however, noticed a change at a company event in late 2017.\n\nHundreds of SpaceX employees gathered around mission control at the rocket company\u2019s headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif., in anticipation of Musk, who was nearly an hour late to arrive at the all-hands meeting about the company\u2019s latest rocket.\n\nWhen he finally took the stage, Musk was strangely incomprehensible at times. He slurred his words and rambled for around 15 minutes, according to executives in attendance, and referred repeatedly to SpaceX\u2019s Big Falcon Rocket prototype, which was known as BFR, as \u201cBig F\u2014ing Rocket.\u201d \n\nSpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell ultimately stepped in and took over the meeting.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t be learned if Musk was under the influence that day. But after the meeting, the SpaceX executives privately talked about their worries Musk was on drugs. One described the event as \u201cnonsensical,\u201d \u201cunhinged\u201d and \u201ccringeworthy.\u201d\n\nSpiro called the description of the SpaceX incident \u201cfalse as has been confirmed by countless people who were present.\u201d He declined to elaborate on what specifically was false or describe the countless people. \n\nThen in 2018, people familiar with Musk\u2019s behavior said, another incident seemed to mark a turning point for him\u2014and showed that his drug use could have consequences for his businesses. That year, Musk got into trouble with NASA for smoking marijuana on the Joe Rogan show, raising red flags for some about the business impact of Musk\u2019s conduct and causing employees at SpaceX to be randomly tested for drugs. \n\nWorry by board members\nIn addition to violating federal contracts, any kind of illegal drug use would break company policies at both SpaceX and Tesla, and would raise questions about Musk\u2019s executive role at the publicly traded Tesla, where the board has a duty to shareholders to oversee management. \n\nSome Tesla board members over the years have talked among themselves about their concerns over Musk\u2019s alleged drug use but haven\u2019t said anything formally that would end up as an official board agenda item or in meeting minutes, people familiar with the discussions said. Some directors, including current Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm, have gone to Kimbal Musk, who is a Tesla board member and was a SpaceX board member until early 2022, for help with Musk\u2019s behavior, without using the word \u201cdrugs,\u201d the people said. \n\n\nElon Musk spoke at an opening of a Tesla factory near Berlin in 2022. PHOTO: CHRISTIAN MARQUARDT/PRESS POOL\nSome on the board and others close to Musk worried he was on drugs when he tweeted in 2018 about plans to take Tesla private, people familiar with the episode said. Kimbal Musk informally approached Musk about it on behalf of some board members, some of the people said. The tweet brought on an SEC investigation into whether the statement was misleading or false, and resulted in Musk\u2019s agreement to step down as Tesla chairman for a time. \n\nSome close to Musk said they learned he was under the influence during a media interview he gave soon after the tweet when he choked up describing how difficult his year had been.\n\nPart of the issue directors have grappled with over the years is whether drug use by Musk is to blame for his unusual behavior, or if it is something else, such as his consistent lack of sleep, which he has talked about.  \n\nMusk oversees six companies, including social-media platform X, formerly Twitter; his tunneling venture, The Boring Co.; his brain implant startup, Neuralink; and a new artificial-intelligence company, xAI. His business life bleeds into his personal time in a way that is uncommon even for other chief executives.\n\nAt Tesla and X, he has said he regularly slept at the office. He often emails company lieutenants in the middle of the night, and hosts work meetings at midnight. He said he works almost nonstop. \u201cVacation is a strong word,\u201d he said in 2022 court testimony. \u201cFor me, it is email with a view.\u201d\n\nIn a new authorized biography of Musk, author Walter Isaacson described Musk\u2019s \u201cdemon mode\u201d: Musk, Isaacson wrote, entered into a state of intense fury and would frequently lash out at employees and executives. In the Isaacson book, Musk is quoted as saying, \u201cI really don\u2019t like doing illegal drugs.\u201d \n\nMusk and others have attributed his erratic office behavior to his mental health. A Twitter user asked in 2017 if he had bipolar disorder, which can cause mood swings, to which Musk replied affirmatively, although he said he was undiagnosed.\n\nMusk also said, when he hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 2021, that he had Asperger\u2019s, a form of autism.  \n\n\n\nTop, Robyn Denholm, board chair of Tesla, in 2022. Below, Kimbal Musk, brother of Elon Musk and a Tesla board member, in 2022. PHOTO: HILARY WARDHAUGH/BLOOMBERG NEWS, CHET STRANGE/BLOOMBERG NEWS\nDrug use has also been a thorny topic for directors at Musk\u2019s companies because some of them are his close friends, and attend parties and travel with him, according to people familiar with the matter and court documents. \n\nMusk has been known to attend parties and events at Burning Man, the Nevada arts and music festival where drugs are widely used, to blow off steam, according to people close to him. \n\nHe also throws his own private events, where drug use is common, according to people who have attended the parties. \n\nThe executive\u2019s whereabouts are often a closely guarded secret, and he is protected by private security. At his companies, executives and employees often have to sign nondisclosure agreements. \n\nKimbal Musk frequently attends the same parties and events as his brother, including an Art Basel party in Miami in late 2021 when both took ketamine recreationally, according to people with knowledge of their drug use. Kimbal Musk has talked to friends about the benefits of psychedelics, and tweeted in June in support of his wife when she spoke at the country\u2019s largest psychedelic conference about the benefits of the drugs for mental health treatment. \n\nIn 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that Elon Musk microdoses ketamine for depression and also takes full doses at parties. Following publication of the article, Musk tweeted that ketamine is a better way to deal with depression compared with more widely prescribed antidepressants that are \u201czombifying\u201d people.\n\nIn a separate tweet, Musk later said that he had a prescription for ketamine. The psychedelic-like drug can be prescribed \u201coff label\u201d for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and it is also a widely used party drug that can be purchased illegally through dealers.\n\n\nA conference about the benefits of psychedelic drugs in Denver in June. PHOTO: KEVIN MOHATT FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nGovernment contracts\nAs a general rule, board members and executives have long struggled with how to deal with substance abuse at their companies.\n\nSome directors have wondered whether it is their role to police drug use outside the office, saying what executives do in their personal lives\u2014especially with drugs that may be legal in certain instances or states\u2014may not impact their business decisions.\n\nAt most companies, board members aren\u2019t required to investigate an executive for drug use, but they often do take action if they believe it is impacting the business.\n\nThat can include encouraging a leave of absence for treatment or opening an investigation, corporate governance experts say. Drug use is a more challenging issue than other substance problems, such as alcohol, because possessing certain drugs, such as cocaine, can bring felony charges.\n\nIn 2020, former Zappos chief executive Tony Hsieh\u2019s abuse of ketamine ultimately caused executives at the shoe company\u2019s parent, Amazon, to step in, according to people familiar with those events. \n\nAmazon executives gave Hsieh a couple of months to clean up his act, and when he wasn\u2019t able to do so, he resigned. Hsieh was trapped in a house fire while under the influence in late 2020 and later died from his injuries.\n\n\nElon Musk viewed part of a rocket engine at SpaceX in Hawthorne, Calif., in 2019. PHOTO: AUBREY GEMIGNANI/NASA/GETTY IMAGES\nTesla\u2019s code of conduct described the electric-vehicle maker as a drug-free workplace and prohibits all employees, including executives, from using them, even out of the office.\n\nIllegal drug use by employees is also in violation of the rules that govern the more than $14 billion in contracts that Musk\u2019s private rocket company, SpaceX, has with the U.S. government for civilian and military space missions.\n\nFederal contracts require that companies comply with the Drug-Free Workplace Act and foster a drug-free culture with programs and policies, regardless of any state laws that may legalize some usage. Contractors can also lose security clearances because of drug abuse, defined as the use of illegal drugs or prescription medications \u201cin a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d\n\nIn his role as CEO and founder of SpaceX, Musk has a security clearance that gives him access to classified information. \n\nInvestors have often turned a blind eye to concerns about Musk, including his drug use, especially when Tesla is doing well, investors and people close to the board said. And in recent years, Tesla and SpaceX have both performed exceptionally. Tesla stock is up around 1,000% in the past five years, despite declines in 2022, compared with the S&P 500\u2019s increase of around 86% in that time period. Revenue at SpaceX also has soared. \n\n\nA SpaceX rocket took off in Texas in November. PHOTO: ABRAHAM PINEDA-JACOME/EPA/SHUTTERSTOCK\nTweet firestorm\nIn the summer of 2018, some people around the billionaire began getting concerned that he was losing control. \n\nSeveral months after the all-hands meeting at SpaceX, Musk tweeted in August that he planned to take Tesla private at $420 a share\u2014\u201c420\u201d is slang for smoking marijuana\u2014and that he had \u201cfunding secured.\u201d \n\nThe now-infamous tweet set off a firestorm among investors, who scrambled to understand the billionaire\u2019s plans for the electric-car maker. Tesla shares increased more than 6% the day of the tweet. The SEC launched an investigation that resulted in a settlement that included fines of $40 million and Tesla adding two independent board members and overseeing the CEO\u2019s communications. Musk didn\u2019t admit or deny wrongdoing.\n\nBoard members told regulators they didn\u2019t know about Musk\u2019s plans and were taken aback by his actions. Privately some on the board became concerned that Musk was on drugs when tweeting, and some directors briefly discussed among themselves the idea of him taking a leave of absence from Tesla, people familiar with the discussions said.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times soon after, Musk choked up multiple times as he described the intense personal toll of leading Tesla, saying, \u201cThis past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, things were much more dire: Musk had been under the influence as he answered the reporters\u2019 questions, according to people briefed on the episode. The CEO hadn\u2019t informed Tesla\u2019s communications team that he was giving the interview, people familiar with the episode said. \n\nSoon after, Musk smoked marijuana on the comedian Rogan\u2019s show, which can be streamed online. NASA demanded written assurances that SpaceX was complying with the federal drug-free workplace law and spent $5 million in taxpayer dollars on training for SpaceX employees, according to a letter NASA sent to the company and federal contracting records. \n\n\nElon Musk smoked marijuana on comedian Joe Rogan\u2019s show in 2018.\nMusk has said the agency required drug testing at SpaceX for a year.\n\nCorporate contractors must follow standard NASA guidelines for drug tests that usually check for marijuana and cocaine and have the ability to also test for amphetamines, opiates and PCP.\n\nSpiro didn\u2019t respond to a question on what type of drug tests Musk has taken.\n\nAt SpaceX and some of Musk\u2019s other companies, including the tunnel venture Boring Co., executives began warning employees to follow company rules at all times, including to not use illegal drugs, even out of the office, according to people familiar with the warnings.\n\nSpaceX brought in drug-sniffing dogs on a random basis to make sure employees weren\u2019t carrying illegal substances, according to the people. \n\nAt Tesla, Denholm, the current board chair, James Murdoch and other directors sometimes gathered around Kimbal Musk informally during board breaks or after meetings to ask how Elon Musk was doing or if he was getting enough sleep, people familiar with the conversations said. While the directors wouldn\u2019t specifically ask about substance abuse, the people said they understood the questions to be about Elon Musk\u2019s perceived drug use. \n\nRice, the director who didn\u2019t stand for re-election in 2019, raised concerns about his drug consumption more than once in side conversations with board members about Musk\u2019s increasingly erratic behavior during her two year tenure on the board, according to people familiar with her concerns. She informally asked whether the board should investigate and was brushed off, one of the people said.",

      "selftext": "Before I start: A Tesla has two batteries. The HV battery charges the 12V battery, and if that fails, the 12V battery will drain quickly. The 12V battery powers the suspension, the door locks, the on board computer and so on. \n\nOutside of every service center, you will se plenty of cars with dead HV batteries. While there are very few cars there now because of the holidays, I still managed to find one with a failed battery (there are a grand total of 7 Teslas waiting for repairs). \n\nFirst, the air suspension will constantly use a little power to balance the car. Because of that, it will sink when there's no power. Notice how the entire car \"rests\" on the wheels. It isn't leaning over to one side, which it would have done if the suspension itself was damaged. \n\nSecond, notice how the front panel is missing. You need to remove this to access the starter battery. The starter battery will die if the HV battery fails, and without that, you cannot open the car, nor set it into tow mode. \n\nThird, notice the planks and the stones under the wheels. The car is in tow mode and will roll without them. Tow mode cannot be deactivated without power. \n\nAt any given time outside of the holidays, there are 3\u20145 pre-facelift Model S cars that look like this outside the service center. There are also post-facelift versions, as well as Model 3, Y and X with dead batteries there. However, with those cars, it's less obvious, since you use a different approach to access the 12V battery. \n\nI'll take more pictures once the holidays are over. Keep in mind that the VW, Audi, BMW, Skoda, MG, Toyota and Ford dealerships are right nearby (Forus, Norway). None of them have any EVs with dead batteries.\n\nThe local scrapyard also have plenty of Teslas that have never seen a collision. Some are just out of warranty.\n\nBuy cheap, buy twice. An electric BMW is 30% more expensive than a Tesla, but it also lasts twice as long.",

After a couple hours of roadside assistance and a charging vehicle we managed to get it to the nearby charger though.\n\nThat evening my girlfriend got a message in the app that a door was left open, we did not think much of it and hit lock and went to sleep.\n\nWhat came the next day surprised me much more, when I walked to the charger to grab my car and go to work - there was only a charging cable left!\n\nI immediately looked in the app, and my built in anti theft GPS, my car was on the other side of the city. Called the police, and Tesla straight away.\n\nWhen I got to the car there were no signs of forced entry, and only one recording from the trunk (right after my wife hit lock) showing 2 guys with a massive backpack stealing as much as they could from inside the car.\n\nI of course contacted my local Tesla rep (NL) to figure out what happened, I was not missing any entry keys... Tesla told me this was high priority and incredibly strange, they told me they would escalate it ro management and update me ASAP, they also told me to request additional footage through a form.\n\nIt turned out the car had recorded nothing, eventhough the thiefs scrapes rims on the side of the road and even managed to make a scratch that looks like hitting a pole or building.\n\nI have also never heard back from Tesla regarding how these people could get in my car without force, drive it, and even hit stuff, without me getting any notice... which makes me think this can happen at any given time in the future\n\nLong story short, is there any way to disable the Tesla locking system and replacing it with a mechanical one with a key? My car has been customized and is quite expensive - and due to no signs of forced entry, police did not want to look into the theft.",

If the chargers are installed, and someone charges a cyber or semi, the rate payer (whomever that is supposed to be in this model) gets stuck with the demand charges that now recur every month.\n\nAt 1000 kW, that Pacific Power CA utility demand fee would be $15,500 PER MONTH, at a minimum. Even if just one (1) truck charges at this high level 3 charging, that power demand is set for the next 11 months. Certain electrical utilities are certainly different but ratcheting/revolving demand fees are common. \n\nYou have to pay for at least a portion if not all of the demand every month whether you use it or not.\n\nTesla has hit a wall here with this roll out.\n\nWho is supposed to absorb the demand charge?\nHow would anyone be on board being responsible for this electrical responsibility/liability?\nAnd hope and pray that a Tesla semi or cyber comes rolling by for a charge?\nYou would have to have semi and cyber trucks lined up for hours and charge them one at a time for this to make any financial sense.\nHow could you (or a truck stop) possibly set charging fee rates on this model? \n\nThere's no way that's possible. You think truck stops are going to speculate revenue? At these prices of power usage? No way. \n\nThoughts?\n\nI don't see how a roll out is possible, other than people like Frito-Lay and Pepsi who charge inhouse, avoid paying retail power rates.  But they absorb the demand fees internally as well. The financials on that model don't look very good at all either.",

He\u2019d rather remove features to see if the plebes will pay more for something less effective.. It\u2019s why Teslas will always have a subtle cheap undertone. As long as it looks cool and does a moderate job it makes its way into prod.  Example: Falcon wing doors. \n\nAs a dedicated fan boy, I have to confess, its a wonderful feeling knowing that when I careen off the road due to auto wipers failing causing my not to see , I can take comfort knowing car was built better to handle accidents so I have a better chance of walking away.  \n\nThe Tesla experience is just one big beta test.  \n\nIn all my years in the IT industry, I never saw people pay big money in order to beta test until Tesla came along with FSD. \n\nI\u2019ve test driven a few competitors and cannot wait to buy one but won\u2019t until the car comes with the NACS connector standard.  \n\nAnyways I know this article isn\u2019t about Tesla, but or FSD  The same basic critique remains in this article.

I didn\u2019t think much of it till the 3rd day. \n\nIt constantly shows I\u2019m outside my house. Doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal but navigating anywhere, predicating charge remaining and range available, pre heating the battery, and most importantly using autopilot all rely on GPS. It won\u2019t let me go over 25 on the highway if I use it. \n\n I\u2019ve tried soft resets, hard resets, making sure the software is up to date. Nothing. The service center has moved my appt 3x.

I don't know what else might be damaged, but I'm sure you'll talk to the insurance to figure out what will get covered.\n\nI then sign a repair plan.\n\nI get a call from the repair person saying hey we found some other damages. Were you in another accident? I said no I was not in any other accident. This is the only accident I've been in so it's probably related to that and then he basically says okay. I'll fix it and then I'll talk to the insurance.\n\nSo I'm assuming that means it'll get cleared by the insurance and we'll get covered by them.\n\nWell turns out that some parts that they repaired were deemed not related to the accident by the insurance and now that they've already been fixed Tesla's asking me to pay them.\n\nBut I never agreed to pay for anything and I never even got the cost of repairs that I would have to pay beforehand to either agree or disagree in the same fashion that the insurance company got to do.\n\nNone of the conversations regarding damages, pictures of damages or the cost of repairs was ever sent to me. It was sent straight to the insurance company.\n\nNow they're saying I can't get my car back until I pay and that I agreed to the extra charges over the phone.\n\nNothing has been communicated to me in writing or in the Tesla app as I assume it's supposed to be dealt with.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nEDIT: Eventually they changed their tuned, apologized and I have my car back with no extra cost to me.",

Workers still got modest cost-of-living increases and adjustments to their base salaries.\n\nDuring annual performance reviews, employees usually get salary adjustments as well as merit-based stock grants on top of their existing equity. But this year, even high performers didn\u2019t get the merit-based grants, the employees said. Some Tesla employees who reached the end of their four-year vesting cycle were still given stock \u201crefreshers,\u201d in order to keep their total compensation competitive.\n\nTesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has long stressed the importance of employee stock ownership. The use of those grants has allowed the electric-vehicle maker to keep total pay high while preserving cash, and Musk has credited the compensation method with helping him fend off unionization pushes.\n\n\n\u201cThe challenge is: How do we retain great people to do the hard work of building cars when they have, like, six other opportunities that they can do that are easier?\u201d Musk said at the New York Times DealBook Summit last month. \u201cWe certainly try hard to ensure the prosperity of everyone.

      "selftext": "With models S, Y and 3 now dropping into the tertiary market (third owner and beyond) a whole new demographic of Tesla drivers are hitting the streets. AS FAST AS THEY CAN!\n\nWhere I live is the canary in this particular coal mine. The Bay Area. Every dickhead who would have bought an AMG or. Maserati they couldn\u2019t afford the upkeep of is jumping head first into the premium luxury wonder world of Tesla ownership.\n\nThe process seems to go like this: Buy car. Get tints and wrap. Have badges painted red. Drive like an absolute asshole. Crash. Driving around Oakland I saw three intersection smashes involving Teslas in *one day*\n\nAs someone who\u2019s spent a lot of time at racetracks, I can see driver assists better than most when watching other vehicles. (I\u2019m so glad the era of people tracking Model S cars on SCCA open/unlimited days are past) - But I still see it with modern cars all the time. No judgement. I actually think the average GT-R owner should have everything turned on, even if I\u2019m very much of the analogue bent. Point being, I see driver assists keeping these cars from crashing all the time. Freeway entrances, surface street corners, accelerating away from lights on a curved street.\n\nWe also have a unique problem here. Traffic tight timing across Oakland varies by up to three seconds. In West Oakland, lights change their perpendicular direction immediately. In most of the town, it\u2019s about 1.5-2 seconds. In Piedmont it\u2019s 3. So how much time an amber light affords you is totally inconsistent.\n\nThis leads to this new group of Tesla drivers to floor it when the light turns amber, and launch when they get a green. It\u2019s a bad combination.\n\nAll the body shops are filling with them. Under CA law, you can take the cash from your claim if you like. So people are going to Tesla approved shops to get quotes, then having them repaired (not very well, but wrap, right?) at low end Bondo shops.\n\nThis cost *is* going to be increasingly passed onto Tesla drivers with full coverage. Mark this post on this date and check back in year. It\u2019s going to be a total disaster, far offsetting the price of gasoline.\n\nAs a huge EV fan, (and former Tesla owner) I really hope this is kept as brand specific and doesn\u2019t reverberate across the sector.",

The god damn Y and it's stupid vision based ACC can't drive right when it's misty, you get a pop up that the visibility is bad, and you slow down to a crawl.

The Microlino at least has a display in front of the driver, which displays the damn speed you're going...\n\nOh well, got musked once again :(\n\nMorale of the story, if you want ACC get a car with radar, I never had this problem on my old VW Golf from 2015",

      "selftext": "(I'm posting this here because it seems like the best place to get a variety of opinions.)\n\nSo, I'm gonna need a new car soon. I have driven an econobox my whole life and would be happy to keep driving an econobox. But I also think climate change is *the* challenge of our time and really am ready to be done with burning gas, so I'd like to buy an EV. \n\nI very much *don't* want a SUV. I don't want to contribute to the gigantification of cars, where people buy bigger cars to see over the people buying bigger cars. (I'm a cyclist too, and we feel that doubly.) So Ioniq 5 and id.4 and the various Kias are out. I'll need to make several 1000 mile road trips each year, so the Bolt is out, even though it looks like a great car otherwise.\n\nThe one that seems to meet this requirement is ... the Model 3, as \"reasonably efficient and economical thing that runs on electrons.\" I don't need all the gadgetry or the expense that comes with it, but all the good small cars aren't sold in the US (BYD, etc.) I'd probably go M3LR, since I live in a cold snowy place (where bigger battery + AWD seems helpful). It's far fancier than the econoboxes I'm used to, but it doesn't burn gas, and I can stretch my budget to afford it. \n\nBut I've got two huge reservations:\n\n1. I don't like some of Tesla's business practices. Monopolizing repair means that I've got to wait on their service and pay whatever they charge to fix very fancy electronics in a fender-bender rather than taking it to the guy down the street and saying \"can you get a new Toyota rearview mirror from a junkyard and stick it on for me? No I don't care if it's the same color.\" And, of course, Tesla overpromises and underdelivers for all kinds of whizbangery (cybertruck, FSD, robotaxis, whatever other crazy thing Elon talks about this week). And, of course, locked-down software sucks. (I'm posting this from a Framework laptop running Linux, which should tell you my values in that regard.)\n2. Elon is an asshole and I don't want to support him.\n\nBut the flip side of this is that Tesla has probably done more to decarbonize transportation than any other company out there. Elon's a dangerous and malevolent clown and deserves no credit, but there are a bunch of real engineers doing real work out there. Even if the company isn't perfect, the alternative is the legacy car makers like Ford (happily selling bajillions of F-150's per year), most of whom probably have CEO's who are also shitheads but less publicly than Elon.\n\nSo I guess my questions for y'all are:\n\n1. How bad do Tesla's business practices make the experience of actually driving a Tesla? Can I expect a reasonably reliable car (for basic car things like \"get me from A to B\", not fancy infotainment) that isn't a money pit? I don't care about cosmetic stuff (\"panel gaps\" or whatever don't bother me unless they interfere with reliability or efficiency), but if I'm going to be paying massive repair bills, that's a nope. \n2. How have other people reconciled the \"Elon is actively bad for the world but so is gasoline\" conflict?\n3. Are there any alternatives to Tesla for my use case? Seems like the only close one is Ioniq 6, but that's bigger than I want and fancier than I want.",
