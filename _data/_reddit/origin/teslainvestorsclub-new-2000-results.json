      "selftext": "Hi all, I'm curious to know how others are projecting **robotaxi timing geofenced within major metropolitan regions of the US**, since I suspect for many of us that's a major aspect of the Tesla investment story. I estimate a 2026/2027 reveal is likely (following M2 production) but rollout happens ~2028-2030.\n\nFeedback I'm looking for:\n\n1. What changes to my analysis push the date forward/backward?\n\n2. Are there alternative metrics that indicate a different robotaxi timeline?\n\n3. Is miles-to-critical-disengagement even a useful metric for this estimation?\n\n---\n\nTLDR; Robotaxis in 2028-2030 (today's progress continued), pessimistically 2032-2038 (halved growth speed). \n\nThe FSD tracker shows a 2.5x bump in miles-to-critical-disengagement (mi/cde) w/ V12. Data-points for the first tracked release of each major FSD version:\n\n* 10.10.2 (Feb 2022) 43mi/cde\n* 11.3.4 (Mar 2023) 144mi/cde - 3x improvement vs v10.10.2\n* 12.3 (Mar 2024) 380mi/cde - 2.6x improvement vs v11.3.4\n\nUsing mystical chart reading powers, it looks like we're optimistically getting a 2.5x gain annually. Assuming this progress can be extrapolated, we'll be at ~1000mi/cde next year. Let's assume Robotaxi in 2025 has better compute hardware for a 1.5x multiplier and front-headlight cameras for a 1.5x multiplier. That gets us to 2250mi/cde in 2025, then 2250*2.5=~5600mi/cde in 2026.\n\nThrowing together two datapoints:\n\n* \"Car insurance companies estimate you as the average driver will crash your car once every 17.9 years, or roughly 3-4 times in their life.\"\n\n* \"On average, Americans drive 14,263 miles per year according to the Federal Highway Administration.\"\n\nThat's, on average, 256000mi per accident (let's say 256k-500kmi/accidents). Conflating CDEs with mi/accident (likely not having a comparable metric for human drivers), we'd seem 50x away in 2026 and expect statistical break-even w/ human drivers by 2030.\n\nObviously, this doesn't account for black-swan events... perhaps, if there's an ML breakthrough tomorrow that improves mi/CDE 10x, we'd anticipate break-even around 2028. And if the multiplier lowers (say to 2x) that increases the timeline to log2(256/(0.38\\*2.25)) = 8y from now, 2032... with a 1.5x multiplier we'd be be at log1.5(256/(0.38\\*2.25)) = 14y from now, 2038.\n\nI suspect many replies in this thread will state \"but Tesla is bringing up a big compute cluster this year!\" or \"but they're doing end-to-end!\". I'm curious to know what evidence we have that this isn't already captured by the 2.5x multiplier. Regarding remote operators & geofenced optimizations, I've optimistically placed that into the 10x multiplier for the optimistic 2028 timeline.",

In particular, the average price reduction would be ranging from 10% to 15% when we compare the respective selling prices observed in 2023Q1 and 2024Q1.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this scenario, even if we assume Tesla is able to maintain a flat YoY delivery trend, taking into account the 10% to 15% reduction in the selling price, overall automotive sales for 2024Q1 will experience at least 10% YoY drop.\n\nFor a company with Forward P/E at around 60 times, 10% YoY drop in the core revenue stream (remarks: automotive sales contribute 80% of total revenues) does not look promising.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor related analyses and statistics, please read\n\n**Latest weekly insurance registration data in Mainland China and estimate of global deliveries in 2024Q1 \\[19 March 2024\\]**\n\n[https://new.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1biwcdn/latest\\_weekly\\_insurance\\_registration\\_data\\_in](https://new.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1biwcdn/latest_weekly_insurance_registration_data_in)\n\n**Registration numbers across Europe in the first two months of 2024 \\[21 March 2023\\]**\n\n[https://new.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1bk3iyl/registration\\_numbers\\_across\\_europe\\_in\\_the\\_first](https://new.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1bk3iyl/registration_numbers_across_europe_in_the_first)\n\n**Estimate of deliveries in Mainland China for March 2024 \\[23 March 2024\\]**\n\n[https://new.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1bm28xc/estimate\\_of\\_deliveries\\_in\\_mainland\\_china\\_for](https://new.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1bm28xc/estimate_of_deliveries_in_mainland_china_for)",

So many minds being blown. Personally I'm extremely bullish based on the feedback that people are posting.\n- A few testers (mostly on S and X vehicles) have experienced tire or rim damage as a result of tight curbs.

      "selftext": "With reference to the data released by China Passenger Car Association, Tesla had recorded 39,881 deliveries in January 2024 (representing around 6.0% of total new energy vehicle sales in January 2024) and 30,141 deliveries in February 2024 (representing around 7.8% of total new energy vehicle sales in February 2024).\n\nAccording to the latest press release issued by China Passenger Car Association, it is expected that the number of new energy vehicle to be delivered in March 2024 would be around 750,000 units. In case Tesla is able to maintain its market share at 7.8% (i.e. its market share throughout full year 2023 and February 2024), the implied deliveries throughout March 2024 would be around 58,500.\n\nOn the other hand, based on the weekly insurance registration data released in Mainland China, around 32,800 units of Tesla were registered between 01 March 2024 and 17 March 2024. On a pro-rata basis, the implied deliveries throughout March 2024 would be around 59,800.\n\nAfter all, the estimated deliveries in Mainland China for March 2024 could be ranging from 57,000 to 63,000 (i.e. 60,000 +/- 3,000). If it is the case, total deliveries in Mainland China for 2024Q1 would be ranging from 127,000 to 133,000 - which would be a bit less than the record achieved in 2023Q1 (i.e. 137,429).\n\nNote: Insurance registration data for the week ending 24 March 2024 will be released by 26 March 2024, which shall enable us to refresh the estimate for March 2024 and 2024Q1.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor related analyses and statistics, please read\n\n**Latest weekly insurance registration data in Mainland China and estimate of global deliveries in 2024Q1 \\[19 March 2024\\]**\n\n[https://new.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1biwcdn/latest\\_weekly\\_insurance\\_registration\\_data\\_in](https://new.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1biwcdn/latest_weekly_insurance_registration_data_in)\n\n**Registration numbers across Europe in the first two months of 2024 \\[21 March 2023\\]**\n\n[https://new.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1bk3iyl/registration\\_numbers\\_across\\_europe\\_in\\_the\\_first](https://new.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1bk3iyl/registration_numbers_across_europe_in_the_first)",

      "selftext": "I'm doing an updated DCF analysis following TSLA's recent price drop and I want clarity on some assumptions.\n\nCurrently the maximum production for TSLA's factories are:\n\n||Model S/X|Model 3/Y|Semi|Cybertruck|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Fremount|100,000|550,000|||\n|Nevada|||(Pilot)||\n|Shanghai||950,000|||\n|Berlin||375,000|||\n|Texas||250,000||125,000|\n|**Total**|**100,000**|**2,125,000**|**0**|**125,000**|\n\nThis adds up to 2.35m. However, TSLA sold \\~1.8m vehicles in 2023, of which \\~500k were the Model 3 and \\~1.2m were the Model Y.\n\nCurrently TSLA has excess production capacity but since Model 3/Y sales have stagnated, this is being underutilised. \n\nTSLA currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 40. I believe this is pricing in the next growth phase when the next-generation vehicle is released. The current rumours are that it'll begin mass production in July 2025, and I've assumed it'll take 18m to ramp up to a \\~500,000 production rate (December 2026) with annual production of 1.3m by Dec 2027.\n\nSo by December 2027, I am assuming the following sales:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Model S/X|60,000 (slightly lower than now)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Model 3|500,000 (same as now)|\n|Model Y|1,000,000 (slightly lower than now)|\n|Semi|75,000|\n|Cybertruck|400,000|\n|Roadster|60,000|\n|$25,000 Vehicle|1,300,000|\n\nThis totals \\~3.3m and by this time, Gigafactory Mexico will be up and running so along with expansions of of other sites, TSLA should have enough capacity.\n\nI know I'm only looking 4 years ahead, but how is TSLA expecting to ramp up to 20m in the following 3 years? Elon Musk has commented the need for 10-12 Gigafactories by 2030 but that doesn't seem sensible with these assumed sales figures. I've only included TSLA's announced vehicles but they cover a large variety of market segments so I don't personally think the next major growth driver will be a new vehicle; it'll have to be something like energy storage or FSD.\n\nSo I want to discuss my assumed vehicle sales numbers. Am I not being optimistic enough? What are the predicted sales numbers for the next generation vehicle?  Baring in mind that the US is typically not a large market for hatchbacks and the top-selling hatchback of 2023 was the Toyota Corrolla, which sold \\~1m. Personally, I think the biggest wildcard is the Tesla Semi, since sales of heavy truck vehicles are predicted to reach 4.76m by 2030, which not only makes 75,000 seem very low, the margins are also likely to be greater. But even if you assume \\~2m Semi sales, that's still \\~5m annual sales, well off 20m.\n\nWhy would another 4-6 Gigafactory's be needed and what would they produce?",

      "selftext": "Since 2020 or 20201 -- maybe even before then -- Musk has been saying that Tesla is an AI company. That's one of the reasons I've invested. I'm a believer in FSD, among other things. But I feel like the xAI announcement is a complete conflict of interest for Musk.\n\nWe are seeing rapid progress in humanoid robots outside of Tesla. Most recently OpenAI teamed up with Figure to do [some really impressive things.](https://youtu.be/A9RWMtU672M?t=28) I am glad Tesla is also working on a bot that should be able to do impressive things eventually, but I'm guessing they will partner with xAI instead of developing their own LLM themselves, in house.\n\nIs Tesla developing a large language model, similar to ChatGPT, Grok, etc. or have they just abandoned such an idea -- presumably on Musk's authority? I understand Tesla is a leader in certain aspect of AI. But it seems LLM's will be critical for any company that sells itself as an AI company.\n\nIf Tesla is not developing an LLM model in-house, this seems like a critical problem. Yes, they can partner with Grok or some other company, but outsourcing the brain of your AI to another company, instead of developing it in-house seems precisely the kind of thing Musk would not and should not do, unless he had a conflict of interest. It's like the auto companies outsourcing the engines of their cars, which Musk has long decried. And rightly so.\n\nAre there any other investors who are concerned about this? Am I just misinformed -- and maybe Tesla is developing an LLM?\n\nJust wondering what other TSLA investors think about this issue. Thanks.",

Setting another Gigafactory in southern Asia could be strategic, but not very effective at all.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla has been postponing the building of Gigafactory in Mexico, at least no concrete development so far. Reason is simple, the existing annual production capacity across the world (i.e. around 2.20-2.30 million S/3/X/Y vehicles + 125k CT) is able to cover the estimated deliveries until mid 2025 at least in view of the lower growth expected. New producton capacity will be required only when new mass market product is launched - which would be Model 2 as previously predicted.\n\nMoreover, if Tesla has to choose between Mexico and India, suppose Mexico would be the right choice given it would be easier for US based technicians to travel to Mexico instead of sending them to India (at least US based technicians would be more willing to stay in Mexico ...).\n\nLastly, let's do the maths again. How much can be made from the Indian market with lower tax on import vehicles in the next 1 to 2 years (note: only 8,000 import vehicles would be able to enjoy the lower duty as per policy)? Assume all 8,000 quotas are utilized whereas average gross profit per vehicle would be 7,000-7,500 currently, that would be equivalent to 56-60 million gross profit per year only. Bear in mind that if Tesla is running a Gigafactory in India, Tesla will no longer be required to import finished vehicles from China or Germany to India ... rather it should sell the vehicles built locally.\n\nJust feel free to discuss \\~\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/23x5cwko2koc1.jpg?width=585&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc7238c8b42faf3f3c7c05cb8d976813fc3e345f\n\n[https://twitter.com/TeslaClubIN/status/1768562631500025962](https://twitter.com/TeslaClubIN/status/1768562631500025962)",

      "selftext": "With all the negativity around I figured I'd just write some thoughts about Tesla's future businesses and why I'm optimistic.\n\n**Insurance:** when you're a company with tens of millions of cars on the road that you repair yourself and can modify the car and reduce repair costs in-house, plus you have cameras all over the very cars you are insurance, that sounds like a pretty advantageous setup for this business doing well in the future.\n\n**Energy:** Some people claim 'the margins will dry up,' but with lithium refining, battery manufacture, scale, software, inverters and other technology, experience, and auto-bidding, there is a lot more than just 'putting batteries in a box.' If Tesla adds value and their vertically integrated supply chain and battery manufacture plus long term battery supply negotiation means they pay less per KWH than competitors, their margins should be fine. This business grew 125% last year and should be huge in the future.\n\n**Autonomous Cars:** Is there a good case that somebody else might crack this before Tesla? Probably not. The 'Data Moat' of having millions of cars with cameras on the road, plus Apple giving up, the likelihood that someone else with a dearth of data and without tens of millions (in a few years) cars on the road is going to beat Tesla to this is highly unlikely. Even if it takes a while, the 'Tesla will be first to car autonomy' idea is still intact.\n\n**Humanoid Robots:** The stuff FigureAI and some other companies are making seems pretty impressive, but being a massive manufacturer already gives two HUGE advantages.\n\n1. You are more likely to be able to cheapen and scale up production of the robot\n2. The car manufacturing business makes you for first customer. The fact that Tesla could operate even at a loss for a few years ironing out the kinks and adopt+practice using their own robots at mass scale gives them a huge advantage. Then also: It is likely that only the humanoid robotics companies who are also highly proficient in AI are going to win (leaving OpenAI and Tesla)\n\n**PowerWall:** CATL says battery costs will drop 50%/kwh in the next year or so. I think people are going to be surprised how cheap and performant green energy/batteries are going to be within the next few years. We're at this inflection point where green stuff is competitive with, but not profoundly better than the alternatives. In a few years, the economics will be so tilted that one would be stupid to not use wind, solar, batteries. If enormous numbers of people get on powerwalls that dream of Tesla autobidder + powerwall + solar panels essentially becoming like a power utility sounds possible.\n\n**Then a huge catalyst** - as the AI revolution continues, many people are speculating that electricity is going to become the bottleneck for training AI models. We're going to 2x-3x our energy needs in not that long.\n\nThere are out-sized returns on making wind turbines larger - the largest wind turbines are starting to generate 16MW of power. This means that only 60 of them are as good as a full blown Nuclear power plant.\n\nA Nuclear Power Plant costs $2-10/MW  \nLarge wind turbines cost $1.2M/MW\n\nIf wind turbines keep improving, the economics of Wind Turbines + Megapacks is going to be insane.\n\n20% of US energy is renewable already. Investment, capability, and cost per MH are all improving rapidly. You only need to double that a few times and you're literally >100% of our current total production in renewables.\n\nWe're at the beginning of some serious Tony Seba style shenanigans.",

      "selftext": "The proposed $6B legal fee for the Deleware case that rescinded Elon Musk\u2019s compensation package is harmful to us shareholders regardless how you feel about Elon Musk and the comp package. It harms us in three ways - new shares would have to be issued to pay the fees, which would dilute our holdings while making the attorneys a top 10 holder. Then the attorneys could in theory vote their shares against our interests. And the final harm is that they proposed no restrictions on when and how they can sell, which means they can just dump the shares on the open market (remember when Elon sold billions in 2022 and cratered the stock, and the stock still hasn\u2019t fully recovered despite the broader market at all time highs?).\n\nSo there is a campaign to make sure that the Deleware court is flooded with letters opposing the legal fee:\n\nhttps://x.com/teslaboomermama/status/1764425180116660320?s=46&t=tR1HmRezK8kVu8Ep9gB5gw\n\nThe big point is that there is no financial benefit from what the lawyers achieved. The lawyers argue they won a $55 billion financial benefit for shareholders by rescinding Elon\u2019s comp package, but in fact, the Tesla board could simply put the same $55B package to a revote with proper disclosures (as requested in the original complaint), meaning that there was no financial benefit, only a procedural one.\n\nTo protect our interests, I highly recommend that we write letters to the court. This is also time sensitive as the judge will be deciding the attorneys fee in the next few weeks. Instructions on where to address and what points to include are in the X post above.\n",

While the total worldwide BEV sales number has a small margin of error, the columns about percentage of Tesla\u2019s sales and YoY growth are 100% accurate.\n\nIn red, manufacturers that have lost BEV market share or lost ground on Tesla. \nIn green, manufacturers that have gained 1% or more market share.\n\nTesla lost market share in 2021 and in 2022 as competitors were entering the arena, but then gained market share in 2023. This despite having only 2 models, despite selling BEVs twice the price of the Chinese-BEV average, and despite having the largest unit number to grow from - increasing their total fleet by 50%. This is quite an achievement.\n\nI hope this gives you all more confidence in the management. As for me, I\u2019m back in 100%. \ud83c\udf7b",

      "selftext": "1)\n\nThere's no such thing as board independence at companies with Founder-CEOs.\n\nFounders own a huge % of the company and therefore have the most voting power. Board members are elected by shareholder vote, meaning founders have the most power to get board members elected. Board members have the power to oust CEOs. Naturally, founder-CEOS place their allies on the board so they can maintain control of their company. No founder is going to put strangers on the board for the sake of independence and risk getting kicked out of their own company.\n\nCompanies with dual class shares, e.g. Zuck at Meta, have an even bigger problem with board independence because founders like Zuck can single-handedly elect whoever they want to the board with no opposition because he has >50% voting power.\n\nMeta's board is all hand-picked by Zuckerberg and has members such as:\n\n* Sheryl Sandberg, Zuck's former right-hand woman and COO at Meta\n* Peggy Alford, CFO of Zuck's charity\n* Marc Andreessen, Zuck's VC partner for Meta since its start-up days\n* Andrew Houston, CEO of Dropbox and well-known friend of Zuck\n\n[Alford, Andreessen, and Houston are all on the Compensation Committee at Meta.](https://investor.fb.com/leadership-and-governance/compensation-and-governance-committee-charter/default.aspx)\n\nIn addition, [Techcrunch details how shareholders have tried to oust Zuck several times but couldn't because the board, which is filled with Zuck's friends, protected him.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/03/drew-houston-facebook-board/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADzdmIu45rQibjWQb08wpHli28Ey31hueVtMsrpRZcxptueipumJ4vCruNZlxP8dnHApFrU8t200XR0skTvh5lBhCqK6Zqr2S13d0v6NMorhojFUuVz382e8jTsKceGOS9UwPhthRhdY4eiJM7MYDqSZXonUP0cAkNO-sf_1AvpI)\n\n2)\n\nWilliam Savitt, has played a leading role in high-stakes corporate governance and merger-and-acquisitions litigation in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the same court and judge as Elon's compensation ruling) and in courts around the country. [Mr. Savitt represented Twitter in successful litigation against Elon Musk](https://www.wlrk.com/attorney/wsavitt/) when Musk sought to terminate his $44 billion merger agreement, compelling the deal close on its agreed terms in October 2022.\n\nIronically, he also wrote an article discussing [\"The Dangers of Independent Directors\"](https://www.wlrk.com/webdocs/wlrknew/AttorneyPubs/WLRK.25278.16.pdf) and how it's actually better to have non-independent directors on the board because they actually have useful knowledge regarding the business and are emotionally attached to the company.",

AI = autonomous driving. Invested in dojo/ infrastructure/ talent acquisition.\n- Elon was going to not even include steering wheel for next gen.\n- Included cameras in all cars\n- Keep removing parts useful for actual driving\n- Willing to sell cars at expense of margin.\n- Limited model variety compared to competitors.\n- Elon likes to say Tesla one day be biggest company by market cap. That requires special operating leverage (not hardware sales).\n\n#2\n- Not ideal car for actual driving especially for older people (and there will only be more of them with time). No USS, birdeye view, no dash display/ HUD, regen brake, too much touch screen, no stalks. Abled drivers can overcome them, but not welcoming for older people. This restricts TAM.\n- Stock is too expensive for just low margin hardware business with limited operating leverage (EV/ megapacks).\n- Limited model variety limits TAM.\n\n#3\n- The chatgpt moment will be when general public becomes convinced their old parents and young teenagers need fsd, while taking on liability as driver. No new laws needed. FSD doesnt have to be perfect in all edge cases. It just has to be enough for drivers to subscribe.\n- Complete overhaul of business and operating leverage. No extra expense. Just pure monthly subscription. SAAS business overnight. So in this way, the current discussion about ads and margin is myopic.\n- Increase in demand. Immediate increase in TAM. Significant value to people that value safety. People care less about car model variety. Almost a monopoly overnight. \n- Immediate boost to tesla insurance. High risk drivers pay premium in insurance. If they use fsd, they are not high risk. Another operating leverage.\n- hertz/ used car/ rental market immediately recover. You would want fsd if thats what are used to.\n\nWhen we say Tesla is AI company, run by best management with best talent, we are essentially investing in them figuring this out.\n\nThat\u2019s how I think of it anyways. Would love feedbacks!\n\nX: at eyedoctorjae",

I remember in the late 90s/ early 2000s asking my dad why people were still buying Kodak cameras and why cars were not electric (which of course, he answered in perfectly rational and practical arguments). Started following tesla  kind of late in 2017, went all in in 2019, at the lowest point, after patiently waiting for years. Been ridiculed so many times in 2019 for investing in \"a company that's going to go bankrupt\".\n\nAs I said the short-term results are not great. But whoever invested in Tesla for the sole car business is insane.\n\nLet's talk about the car business though. No legacy automaker can make a good electric car profitably, including the market leader, which is actually the worst-positioned. The only guys who can do that aside from Tesla are the Chinese, and although they are good at it they lack brand image.\n\nLet me tell you something as a teacher: most students are crazy about Teslas. Not just because they are new, but because they get it, unlike many boomers. Also, and I'm not kidding, 95% of my students have iPhones. Which wasn't the case a few years ago. See, brand image takes time to fully develop itself.\n\nAnd it's going to be the exact same for Tesla. Currently a vast majority of people who are looking for a new car are just clueless. The media has done an amazing job at spreading misinformation about EVs and more particularly Tesla, and it's fucking insane. But even if they hadn't, adoption takes time. And I'm not worried about iPhone sales, the same way I'm not worried about Tesla sales in the long run.\n\nStory time: after I bought my model 3 in early 2021, 5 people around me bought one including 4 in 2023. Including my in-laws, who are 65. When people see things for themselves they understand, but often they do need to see it from someone they know.\n\nAnother story: my dad told me yesterday \"hey did you see how Teslas don't work in the cold?\" - he literally sees me going to work every day with below freezing temperatures but still believes the media. Keep in mind we are in France so he saw it from the French media. Even though it happened in Chicago.\n\nTo sum things up: legacy auto sells to boomers, the news loves to trash Tesla, zoomers will buy Teslas like they buy iPhones.\n\nNow that we're done with the car business, let's talk about FSD.\n\nYes, Elon has overpromised and underdelivered. Progress seems slow. But his fundamental thesis is still intact: photons in, controls out. Just like a human. I truly believe that this is the only approach that will work on a large scale. Waymo is great but geofenced, and costs 200+k per vehicle! Looking at FSD12, and even prior builds, it absolutely is an AI, not a hardware problem. How is LIDAR going to help you in an edge case scenario? I think we can all agree that current interventions in FSD are inference and understanding problems, not hardware problems. It is going to take a lot of time to be perfected enough (I do think we need AGI) and once we get it it will need regulatory approval which will take a long time, but it is the only scalable approach.\n\nNot even taking other products into account.\n\nTL;DR: Car is fantastic AND profitably made, with Apple-like brand image. Adoption will take time but future generations are much better informed. FSD is the way.\n\n&#x200B;",

I did register on Tesla's website but the verification has been pending for over a year, I doubt I will ever be able to vote. Kinda sucks but I have no idea if it's even possible to validate my right to vote.\n\nSo first, I have been trying to understand Elon's reasoning. Here's what I'm thinking without giving any opinion: him wanting to keep some control makes sense in his rhetoric, as he is really afraid of the unchecked power of AI. I agree that he then shouldn't have sold shares, but he viewed controlling Twitter as inevitable if he wanted to protect humanity's freedom of speech, whose impediment he considers a threat at least as dangerous as AI. He basically has what he considers moral imperatives to ensure humanity's survival, in our case the control of AI has been hindered by the protection of freedom of speech.\n\nElon is quite often misunderstood because people focus on one of his opinions or actions instead of looking at the whole picture which is quite complex.\n\nAnyway, since Elon wants 25% control, and I do believe he can get us to $5 trillion and we need him, what if enough shareholders were somehow able to hand over their voting rights to Elon while keeping their shares? It's probably an impractical idea but it would actually solve the problem without resorting to dilution or other shenanigans. For me, it wouldn't make any difference as I am not able to vote anyway lol.\n\n&#x200B;",

      "selftext": "Elon Musk has made it known that he is hesitant to put more AI work into tesla because he know longer has the amount of control he used to have.\n\nAt one point Musk had more then 20 percent of the shares in tesla, but since then he has sold down to around 13 percent or so. Most of the money went on to buy twitter.\n\nMany longtime shareholders, myself included, have balked at the idea of offering musk another 12 percent or so in stock options considering it could potentially be worth 10\u2019s of billions if not 100\u2019s of billions of dollars.  It would be unprecedented and should not be offered lightly.\n\nMy idea would be for tesla to ask for 10 percent of spacex taken directly from musk\u2019s portion of the company in exchange for the 13 percent of so of tesla.  \n\nMusk owns 49 percent of spacex and 79 percent of the voting power. He would still maintain control of both companies.\n\nI guarantee that most tesla shareholders would take a haircut just to say they partially own some spacex.  \n\nBecause spacex is much smaller, musk would have goal posts to achieve the full 13 percent.\n\nAny feedback on this idea would be appreciated.",

      "selftext": "Look I understand the hype. Tesla has helped bring EVs into the mainstream and has genuinely pushed the industry forward. The supercharger network was a coup de grace and may be a profitable side business as EVs overall expand. The stock has had an insane run but this valuation cannot continue. I'll post my bear thesis knowing you guys are probably true believers and will downvote me but here I go!\n\n1) Autonomous driving\n\nMERCEDES has the first approved level 3 car in the US. Mercedes! Not the company that has been promising this for ten years. FSD is a joke, no other player in the autonomous industry thinks that ONLY CAMERAS will provide adequate safety. There is HUGE liability from pending NTSB investigations and the software is clearly advertised beyond its limits\n\n2) Technology moat\n\nTesla has unfortunately not created a moat around battery technology, range or charging. Many EVs have similar stated ranges, and Lucid currently holds the range crown. Experienced automakers are coming into the market and can likely compete on thin margins/loss for market share. BEVs are fundamentally simpler than ICE cars and Tesla clearly hasn't created an insurmountable barrier to entry.\n\n3) The \"cool\" billionaire\n\nPlenty has been said about this, but Elons purchase of twitter and clear endorsement of the alt-right is an absolutely terrible move from someone selling environmentally sensible cars. If anything he should be pandering to liberals, but being clearly republican isn't gonna help when they condemn EVs routinely.\n\n4) ItS NoT a cAr CoMpaNy!!\n\nLet's be real. Tesla has no significant foothold in robotics, residential solar or AI. This is a car company typically valued at 5-10 P/E currently at 70. It's not car tech, if Mercedes beat them handily. Tech companies spend more than 4% annual on R&D.\n\n5) Quality issues, recalls\n\nHertz drooped out of buying after about a year. The repair costs are astronomical. Suspension issues, poor plastic interiors, poor service and panel gaps will not survive the wave of better EVs. Polestar, Ioniq, Lucid and Rivian are already making better cars. It won't be long.\n\nFeel free to debate, shit on, but this is my bear thesis. I am short TSLA since $273 in ATM puts. Tear me apart!!!",

Filled out their application and their financing and awaited their response about finalizing the deal.  I get contacted back later to say that Y was no longer available and the next available Y is $36400. I said no. Went on their site and found the exact VIN had gone up in price. Last night I checked again and the same vin is still available for $36700. Bait and switch.",

Again.\n\nAbout a year ago, I brain-dumped a post called [**You need to know what's going on in China**](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/xvlbeq/you_need_to_know_whats_going_on_in_china/)**,** framing what I saw as a huge gap in the public understanding of the Chinese market amid some discussion about Tesla's long-term ability to push market share there.\n\nUntil that point, we'd mostly seen soft-ball entries like the Wuling Mini and Ora Good Cat hitting the market, but as a China-watcher, it was clear that 2023 would be a different year in the Middle Kingdom with domestic players iterating at an incredible rate. Previously-vacant segments were waking up and seeing solid competitive efforts from companies like Geely and BYD for the first time, while boundary-pushing start-up models like the Xpeng G9 and Li L9 were pushing tech not yet adopted by any western automaker.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ql9tqbjlfbac1.jpg?width=1304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9cc2602ccef64fcbb2699b4f2f008f6b9c548f0\n\nThe conclusion was simple: China was no longer a nascent market \u2014 anyone participating there would need to compete hard or get left behind.\n\nA year on, the public understanding has changed significantly. The sudden shift has become incredibly obvious to the wider world as China becomes [the world's largest exporter of cars](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65643064), and Chinese OEMs [start showing up at European auto shows](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/05/world/europe/chinese-automakers-iaa-mobility-german-auto-show.html).\n\nTraditional OEMs have now taken notice, too: Volkswagen is [now an investor in Xpeng](https://ir.xiaopeng.com/news-releases/news-release-details/xpeng-and-volkswagen-group-announce-entry-framework-agreement), and Stellantis is [now partnered with Leapmotor](https://www.stellantis.com/content/dam/stellantis-corporate/investors/events-and-presentations/presentations/STLA-LPM-Partnership-Presentation.pdf), just two of the names we talked about last time. Honda COO Shinji Aoyama probably had my most memorable quote of the year [after visiting the Shanghai Auto Show](https://archive.ph/iOnBQ) and putting it bluntly: \"We were overwhelmed by the Chinese.\"\n\nSo as we enter the new year, it's time for an update:\n\nWhat can we look forward to next, and how will that shape Tesla's path?\n\n*As a reminder: I'm not here to get you to buy any particular stock \u2014 I won't be talking about valuations. I am not an investor in any company listed here. I am not taking a bull or bear position within the context of this post. I run* r/chinacars *for fun, and read up on what's happening in the auto industry there every day (usually with my morning coffee) to better understand what I see as a quite substantive change in the global automotive landscape. I'm only sharing what I've learned for those interested in this part of the equation.*\u00a0\n\n## The Undisputed King\n\nIt would be difficult to attempt any writeup of China without acknowledging the 800-pound gorilla that is BYD, so [let's start there](https://cnevpost.com/2023/12/01/byd-sells-record-301903-nevs-in-nov/): As of Q4 2023, the automaker is now the largest BEV OEM in the world on a quarterly basis, having recorded 525k BEV sales on top of an additional 450k in PHEV sales. BYD leaves 2023 hitting a 2.0M BEV run-rate, and with an increasingly diverse set of offerings. Exports [have tripled over the last year](https://carnewschina.com/2023/12/01/byd-sold-a-record-301903-vehicles-in-november-up-32-with-phev-sales-decreasing/), now holding at 30k per month.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5tz4g9sxjaac1.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cac3a4577f97021e333fbccacf0e5824493dcc9\n\nExpect to see more global expansion from BYD in 2024, and more models to match \u2014 the company will begin taking delivery of its own fleet of export ships, with eight of them on order at the moment. International manufacturing is also now planned, with both Hungary and Brazil announced.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bdicef40kaac1.jpg?width=690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21324aa0071ecf4e25ff2df849b97952b2268e4d\n\nNew entries like the [Yuan Up](https://carnewschina.com/2023/12/08/byd-yuan-up-small-suv-leaks-revealing-pictures-and-specs/) are likely to be big hits in industrializing countries \u2014\u00a0possibly coming in as low as $15k-20k. Meanwhile, as we saw the Seal square up against the Model 3 last year, we'll now see an entire lineup of [Sea Lion](https://carnewschina.com/2023/11/20/byd-announced-sea-lion-is-becoming-a-new-product-line-with-sea-lion-05-and-06-coming-in-2024/) models going up directly against the Model Y.\n\nOther highlights this year will be the broader introduction of two new brands, Fangchangbao and Yangwang, both upmarket offerings for BYD, and both headed for export. Fangchengbao is BYD's 4x4 brand meant to take on the likes of Land Rover, and will start with three models, the [Bao 3](https://carnewschina.com/2023/11/02/byds-fcb-bao-3-exposed-in-china-compact-ev-off-roader/), [Bao 5](https://carnewschina.com/2023/11/09/byd-fang-cheng-bao-bao-5-to-officially-go-on-sale-today/), and [Bao 8](https://carnewschina.com/2023/10/27/byds-fang-cheng-bao-bao-8-spied-in-china-to-launch-in-2024/) \u2014\u00a0however, more interesting is probably Yangwang, the new ultra-luxury halo brand for the automaker. BYD has typically shown unyielding pragmatism in the past, preferring restrained mainstream scale to upmarket razzle-dazzle, so this signifies a big shift for them.\n\nYangwang's first offering is a $150k three-row do-everything EREV SUV capable of putting out over a thousand horsepower, doing tank turns, floating through high flood waters, equipped with satellite connectivity, crammed with compute from NVIDIA, featuring multiple lidar units, and sitting on a brand-new intelligent hydraulic suspension. [It's a showstopper](https://www.byd.com/us/news-list/BYD-Launched-the-U8-Premium-Edition-Under-Its-High-End-Sub-Brand-Yangwang).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yz7t2zd1kaac1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0783763e3de2d93c0f44b0d8595b4331380e274e\n\n***The Tesla Perspective:*** *Having such a small lineup is both an asset and a liability for Tesla. Tesla has done remarkably well holding the sales numbers it has, but also isn't able to play in many of the segments BYD has expanded into, and has minimal access to developing export markets like Brazil. Competitors the size of BYD could do some damage just by forcing Tesla into a price war leveraged by profitable segments and regions where they face less competition.*\n\n*Rushing Gen3 for production in Shanghai first (as Tesla did with Highland) could be the right play here to ensure China is properly-defended territory. A small crossover to compete with the Yuan Plus and Yuan Up will eventually be a must, as will a re-think of the Model X, which lacks the space and luxury Chinese consumers have come to expect from a high-end three-row.*\n\n## Li Auto: The Prodigy\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkqbyo23paac1.jpg?width=1068&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8fe636a1749aee0b741cee961388c3ad3ec21bd6\n\nLi Xiang (known as Li Auto) was becoming a huge rising star in China last time we talked, and that trend has not stopped. The breakout L9 EREV has now been expanded into a full lineup including the slightly smaller L8, and even-smaller-yet L7. Combined, the three models now sell [over 50k units per month](https://cnevpost.com/2024/01/01/li-auto-to-challenge-100000-monthly-800000-annual-deliveries-2024/), which makes Li nearly as popular a brand in China as Tesla is.\n\nThis is notable for a couple reasons: One, because Li's offerings start at RMB 320k \u2014 higher than both the Model 3 and Model Y baselines, and two, because Li Auto was founded in 2015. That's right, this company is only eight years old.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9tcgt78dlaac1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ffcc31dc8a200fcbc3ae328bc5c51468e329816\n\nWe'll see Li add yet another to the L-Series lineup this year \u2014 the L6, Li's smallest. No hard details on this one yet ([just spy shots!](https://cnevpost.com/2023/08/18/spy-shots-li-auto-li-l6/)) but expect it to be a massive seller and priced competitively on the high end of where the Model Y sits.\n\nFinally in March, Li will also start deliveries of the Li MEGA BEV, an audacious MPV design, audaciously specced to match \u2014\u00a0a drag coefficient of 0.215 Cd, an AWD powertrain delivering 400kW and 700km range, CATL's bleeding-edge 5C battery delivering a peak charging rate of 520kW, and adorned with all the interior bits that made the Li L9 a huge success.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/02w7to38laac1.jpg?width=1399&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aac8093e1ff74074284359de416180811ea26a9f\n\n***The Tesla Perspective:*** *Li shows just how competitive Chinese OEMs can be, but probably the most noteworthy aspect of the company is how they've succeeded in rejecting minimalism while embracing maximalism. The L-Series models boast across-the-board AWD, intelligent air suspension, multiple 3K OLED screens, gesture controls, LIDAR arrays, adaptive HUDs, NVIDIA Orin compute, 21-speaker audio systems, electrically actuated footrests and thigh supports, centre-console minifridges, and more. The gull-winged Model X seems positively spartan in comparison.*\n\n*Li also shows a particular peculiar gap in the market for Tesla \u2014\u00a0while the Model Y AWD LR goes for around RMB 300k, the Model X doesn't start until RMB 740k. Li's entire lineup currently sits fully between those two posts on the ground.*\u00a0\n\n## The rise of HIMA: Huawei's Superplatform\n\nLast year we talked a little bit about the AVATR 11, an impressive entry from state-owned Changan. Featuring Huawei-made drive units, electronics, lidar, and infotainment, it was clear at the time the company wanted to become a player in the automotive market, but we were unsure how far those aspirations extended.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1lnpui8akaac1.png?width=2360&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd4d79bd409651b3dd5e9e820b65322728c196c8\n\nWell, we've now seen Huawei's full plan. This November, Huawei formally announced the Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance, or HIMA, their bid to become a major player at the center of China's automotive industry. With HIMA, Huawei is establishing a roll-your-own model to the industry, and will supply cloud services, chips, software, powertrain components, and more to alliance members. By going down this path, Huawei essentially becomes a manufacturer without being a manufacturer and can focus on what it does best \u2014\u00a0the electronics and software side of the equation. It's a big deal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xcdzwwpalaac1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=370afbded7db41f0162dad5b92f88185238af31e\n\nAt least five initial manufacturers have signed on, with nearly a dozen models already released or planned for release. Initial offerings already boast Huawei-designed infotainment and sound systems, Huawei-designed matrix headlights, Huawei-designed compute, Huawei-designed autonomy, and Huawei-designed powertrains. More models are coming, and HIMA members have already collectively announced run-rate goals well past a million units by 2025.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iaev126fkaac1.jpg?width=858&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d02415ffc84cf518e51811b7c079802a4a750c0\n\n***The Tesla Perspective:*** *HIMA presents an interesting challenge for every competing automaker, but it also shows a missing opportunity for Tesla to become a supplier as well as a manufacturer. We've seen some community discussion involving Tesla licensing properties like FSD, but you have to wonder if Tesla could also look into supplying or licensing motors, inverters, and more. We've also seen Tesla start to become a charging infrastructure supplier in North America \u2014\u00a0that same opportunity exists in China, if the cards are played right.*\n\n## The Second Wave\n\nIf last year was a forecast of rain, then what we're seeing this year is a torrential downpour from everyone else. We're now at a point where it would be exhausting to list all the upcoming mainstream EV models from domestic OEMs. What was bleeding edge last year is now table stakes, with gigacasting already in production or entering production at Xpeng, Nio, Leapmotor, Xiaomi, Neta, Changan, and Geely. Next-gen Qualcomm 8295 IVI chipsets, large-format OLED touchscreens, L2+ ADAS, LLM Chat, pop-out door handles, next-gen CATL Qilin packs, and 300kW+ SiC drive units are all rolling out across the industry.\n\nGeely's new Zeekr 007 seemingly takes the full laundry-list of future automotive tech and throws it all into one vehicle \u2014 all of the aforementioned items, plus an 800V electrical architecture, LIDAR-augmented ADAS, satellite communication, and more. Nearly all of this stuff is in-house, [*including the satellite constellation*](https://www.geely.com/en/news/2022/geespace-launches-nine-satellites), I kid you not.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/738va4shkaac1.jpg?width=3765&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5b1d4673e2ce86683b2118614243a99f580e53b\n\nEven the slower state-run manufacturers like Chery and Dongfeng are now joining the fray with the likes of the [e\u03c0 007 ](https://carnewschina.com/2023/10/20/dongfeng-e%cf%80-007-all-electric-sedan-will-unveil-on-november-6-in-china/)and [Exeed Sterra](https://carnewschina.com/2023/11/18/chery-exeed-sterra-es-all-electric-sedan-with-905-km-range-pre-sale-starts-at-34400-usd-in-china/), and bigger names like Changan are now introducing multiple tiers of offerings \u2014 Changan Deepal's SL3i will now be joined by the [AVATR 12](https://carnewschina.com/2023/11/10/avatr-12-launched-in-china-with-578-hp-for-41265-usd/) and [Qiyuan A07](https://carnewschina.com/2023/09/14/changan-qiyuan-a07-sedan-pre-sale-starts-at-21700-usd-with-1200-comprehensive-range/), for instance.\n\n***The Tesla Perspective:*** *Some of these new models will be hits and some will be misses, but collectively they'll all continue to put pressure on the market. I've seen some speculation that this developing market saturation could lead to a whole new round of price wars, and that's something to consider. Tesla would do well continuing to aggressively cost-engineer Highland and Juniper downwards. With this much competition, there may not be enough food at the table for everyone to eat, so going capital-conservative might be the way to go.*\n\n*One of the repeated sentiments I've seen on Chinese social media is that Tesla is no longer the most technologically advanced brand in the market on paper, but consumers report buying it because it's a known quantity in much the same way Toyota is sometimes perceived in the west. In some sense, Tesla is benefitting from early momentum, making it the 'safe' choice for consumers looking to take less of a risk. Maintaining a reputation of quality in consumers' minds will be important going forward as EVs transition from being early-adopter products to mainstream products.*\u00a0\n\n## Five to watch out for.\n\n**Geely Galaxy E8**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mwfpysk7yaac1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da1ca204ea95cc1057fea7a30edf549a0189394a\n\nWhile the Zeekr 007 is catching adoration from the press, Geely's more mainstream Galaxy E8 might be the one to keep track of, with stellar looks, specs to match, and a starting price of around RMB 190k ($26k USD). Stand-out numbers include 0.20Cd aerodynamics and a top-trim 475kW motor setup, but perhaps the most interesting thing for me: Geely's new infotainment system, powered by a Qualcomm 8295 SoC, a sprawling 45-inch 8K display, and Geely's in-house Android-based FlymeOS.\n\nIt's quite the visual statement \u2014 just look at the thing:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oyv6v41rlaac1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbf7b4f506b7c99b50230c8b8298558826e41780\n\n*Deliveries of the Galaxy E8 start in Q1 2024.*\n\n**Aion Hyper HT**\n\nAion is a brand from Guangzhou Automobile Group, a state-run automaker you wouldn't expect to be doing anything remarkable, until you take note of Guangzhou's role at the head of China's tech hub province of Guangdong. GAC got into EVs early with Aion, and has been slowly iterating over the years. The brand now quietly sells nearly 500k BEVs per year, mostly in lower price brackets than Tesla \u2014 but this year they iterate upwards.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i41lchxoraac1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a4e87bbae9fc1805fd3af4370bace2af8c35255\n\nThe highest 'Hyper HT' trim levels boast gullwing doors, a triple-lidar setup with L2+ city driving, an 800V electrical architecture, ultra-fast charging, massage seats, Dolby Atmos audio, and more. On the low end, you're getting a setup quite similar to a Model Y, but several thousand dollars cheaper, with more range and more power.\n\n*Deliveries are imminent.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Deepal S7i**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/le4avjmyraac1.jpg?width=3543&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c715667406b5f5ae65165dc7403296b06e87c8c0\n\nDeepal is already doing quite well in China \u2014\u00a0the HIMA-partnered sub-brand of Changan launched in 2022 as a three-way effort between Changan, Huawei, and CATL. Currently delivering over 100,000 cars per year, the brand [will continue to ramp up](https://carnewschina.com/2023/11/27/changans-deepal-plans-to-sell-450000-evs-in-2024-globally/) next year with the introduction of the brand's TMY-fighter, the S7i. Hard to beat [the formula here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGZ5agTdlos) \u2014\u00a0a no-nonsense mainstream crossover with a CATL pack and Huawei software sold at an attractive price.\n\nMy favourite feature? The passenger display which sits not in the dashboard, but rather in the sun visor, perfect for watching movies on a road trip:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oosp8br2laac1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=daf6b88e8a42c88c2cf08ce879fab03d952a4023\n\n*The S7i is already delivering to the tune of 10k units/month \u2014 expect that to grow.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BYD Song L**\n\nEntries by BYD are rarely exciting on paper, but they somehow usually come together once you see the pricing and features\u00a0 \u2014 the Song L doesn't [disappoint on either](https://carnewschina.com/2023/12/15/byd-song-l-launched-in-china-to-compete-with-model-y-starts-at-26700-usd/):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u1qk6u9bvaac1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4600c62612d8cc7c90b0b315352213a69e2a642b\n\nThe fastback crossover sits on an all-electric e-platform 3.0 and packs BYD's usual Blade architecture into an attractive package with all the fixings \u2014 frameless doors, pop-out handles, 20\" wheels, and a retractable rear wing, as well as BYD's latest 'DiLink' infotainment system. Powered by a 300 hp motor, the Song carries a range of 600km, and a killer starting price of 190,000 RMB, or about $26,000 USD.\n\n*Deliveries are starting now.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Luxeed S7**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z7v7pkbkpaac1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd49155c5763274c4b2fbb1e77e8fbab531f8d2e\n\nYet another play by Huawei's massive HIMA initiative, the Luxeed S7 is a flex, plain and simple. Huawei and partner Chery promise 0.203Cd aerodynamics, up to 855 kilometres of range, an 800V architecture capable of adding 430km in 15 minutes, Huawei's Harmony OS4 infotainment, Huawei's 'Pangu' LLM voice assistant, AI-powered battery-monitoring, computer-controlled dynamic suspension, and Huawei's full ADS 2.0 self-driving package, including L2 city driving and [parking valet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nPapNDA52I).\n\nIt's unlikely the S7 itself will breaking sales records just yet, but watch for the technology being shown off here to trickle down to other models soon.\n\n*Deliveries start in Q1 2024.*\u00a0\n\n## Comparison Table\n\n*Last time, there were requests for some spec-to-spec comparisons, so here it is. Below is a hand-picked selection of vehicles likely to take on the TM3 and TMY over the next year or so in China. Where possible, I've tried to choose the best direct trim competitors to Tesla models \u2014\u00a0in some cases, lower or higher trim levels will be available. Generally speaking, you can expect the SR trims to be cut down on features, but the LR trims to be vaguely equivalent. If you'd like to take a deeper look, here are some additional trim configurations for the listed models:* [*BYD Song*](https://www.bydauto.com.cn/pc/carDetail/config?id=108&networkType=dynasty)*,* [*Hyper HT*](https://www.hyper.com.cn/vehicle/config/table?alias=hyper_ht&cid=50)*,* [*Xpeng G6*](https://www.xiaopeng.com/g6/configuration.html?fromto=GWDHSJ)*,* [*Deepal S7i*](https://www.deepal.com.cn/car/parameter?car=s7i)*,* [*BYD Seal*](https://www.bydauto.com.cn/pc/carDetail/config?id=73&networkType=ocean)*,* [*Galaxy E8*](https://www.galaxy-geely.com/E8)*,* [*Zeekr 007*](https://www.zeekrlife.com/config?modelInfoId=5)*,* [*Luxeed S7*](https://hima.auto/zhijie/s7/configuration/)*.*\n\n*Also note this table doesn't take into account things like limited-time pricing promotions or \"inventory\" discounts common to all manufacturers, Tesla included.

Electric vehicle demand in China is strongly driven by cities where licensing quotas exist \u2014\u00a0for instance [the ICCT notes](https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ID-24-%E2%80%93-NEVs-2023-briefing-A4-70114-v4_final.pdf):\n\n>*In 2015, Shanghai stood out as one of the major cities, alongside places like Shenzhen and Xi'an, where the proportion of PHEV passenger cars exceeded that of BEVs. This trend persisted in Shanghai through 2020 and 2021, with its PHEV share remaining relatively higher than in other cities. However, starting in 2023, Shanghai stopped exempting PHEV freight vehicles from traffic restrictions on urban roads, while continuing this privilege for BEVs and fuel cell electric freight vehicles. It also stopped offering preferential license plate access to PHEV cars, requiring new PHEV buyers to go through the same quota-system auction process as other conventional fuel car buyers.*  \n>  \n>*In addition, for new energy transit buses, the subsidy granted to PHEVs is lower and proportionally reduced based on how the actual fuel savings rate compares with the nominal value recorded in the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT)'s product catalogue. In contrast, Shenzhen relaxed its requirements to apply for a PHEV license plate, making PHEVs more appealing.*\n\nThe CPCA (in Chinese) [elaborates on another set of complexities](http://www.cpcaauto.com/newslist.php?types=csjd&id=3310):\n\n>*The market growth of new energy vehicles is expected to be relatively optimistic in 2024: the wholesale volume of new energy passenger vehicles is expected to reach 11 million units, with a net increase of 2.3 million units, a year-on-year increase of 22%, and a penetration rate of 40%. New energy passenger vehicles remain strong growth momentum.*  \n>  \n>*Judging from the three major purchase groups classified by national insurance data: rental, unit, and private, the current scale of the rental online car-hailing market is close to temporary saturation. The congestion pressure caused by online car-hailing has increased, and income has dropped significantly. The online ride-hailing market is facing problems such as mixed platforms and declining work performance-price ratio, and is on the eve of reshuffle and optimization; demand for pure electric and plug-in hybrid models in the unit electric vehicle market has gradually slowed down, and extended-range electric vehicles have continued to grow in recent months.*  \n>  \n>*In the market, the proportion of new energy in cities with purchase restrictions has declined, the proportion of high-end groups such as financial IT professionals in large cities purchasing electric vehicles has declined, and the proportion of sales in small and medium-sized cities and county and rural markets has increased significantly. Therefore, under the background that the current market scale has developed to a certain level, the growth rate will slow down. The same price strategy for oil and electricity has played a tenacious supporting role in the current market, but in the short term, the profit levels of related companies are under heavy pressure.*\n\nHard to know where this will all land, but the CPCA suggests EREV demand could remain strong, something which seems supported by the sudden upward trajectory of brands like Li.\n\n## Conclusions: Where does Tesla go next?\n\nLast time we talked, I concluded \"Tesla has the wiggle room to maintain sales leadership\" in a way that many of the Chinese domestic brands do not. I think this year has shown the company's ability to navigate that kind of challenge deftly, and some basic analysis suggests Tesla still has room to push volumes.\n\nWe already know Gen3 is coming, but I do consider it essential for Tesla to produce Gen3 in China sooner than anywhere else, and I'm hoping they make that pivot. Lack of diversity in general continues to be a risk for Tesla, and Chinese OEMs are iterating quickly in multiple segments Tesla isn't currently touching.\n\nBoth Highland and Juniper can contribute. Some conservative predictions for Juniper: The adoption of OLED panels and pop-out door handles on higher trim levels, while I think having a lower-trim RMB 220,000 model with a sub-200kW drivetrain could significantly improve TAM and allow volumes to be maintained.\n\nThe important three-row segment is another risk in China, a country where multi-generational households are the norm, and advertisements frequently show mom and dad up front, grandma and grandpa in the second row, and the kids in the back. While the Model Y has some applicability here, I think the Model X (already stale in North America) is a pressing concern \u2014 take a look at [the Huawei Aito M9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaKCTcFEYB4) as an emblem of where the Chinese market is headed, but also note the Li L-Series mentioned earlier, and the complete absence of Tesla in the RMB 400k-700k range.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pebwcbqkkaac1.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4d77ef53b81a62a803c294f2be7ab4c6bad1a6a\n\nSome new business opportunities presented by Chinese competitors: While Musk has pushed X.AI and Grok as a business vertical for X, the adoption of LLMs among Chinese automakers shows a much more obvious path to me. Who among us wouldn't pay an additional $5/mo for an in-car conversational assistant capable of checking restaurant hours, making reservations, navigating around traffic jams on request, and intelligently summarizing new emails?\n\nLooking towards hardware commoditization would be wise. Supercharging seems like an obvious path forward, but if Tesla's next-gen drive units really lead the pack, there's a real opportunity to take on the role of supplier. Same goes with 4680 dry cells, if the program improves.\n\nWhatever happens in 2024, we're in for a trip. Chinese OEMs are overwhelmingly pushing forward with some damned impressive product. Companies like Geely, Li, and BYD firing on all cylinders while Huawei builds up nothing short of an empire.\n\nKeep an eye out \u2014 there's sure to be some really interesting developments.\n\nTLDR:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9q4lvpv7qaac1.jpg?width=2042&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42559a5876762e14a07195b9cc28d674e567436c\n\n## Special thanks\n\nBigs ups to these websites for carrying the torch of English-language coverage of the Chinese market:\u00a0\n\n* [CarNewsChina](https://carnewschina.com/) has been doing this for a long, long time, and is the best bookmark for day-to-day news and model info, with some occasional [great long-form content](https://carnewschina.com/2021/08/01/the-big-read-history-of-byd/).\n* [CnEVPost](https://cnevpost.com/) has a bit more of a financial perspective, and regularly tracks delivery numbers and stock movements, with a focus on startups.

      "selftext": "Been invested in Tesla since 2017 and have held through thick and thin. Just a long summary of my thoughts about the future.\n\n**Investors Day Mar 2023 -** On 3/1/2023 the investor day event was held. A lot of stuff was talked about, including the upcoming next-gen vehicle, but what stuck out to me the most was Master Plan part 3. The vision for moving to an electrified world and the costs involved really stood out. The takeaway, for me, was that it is achievable and it will save trillions in investment over the years. On top of that, moving to electric will improve health (less local pollution from burning fossil fuels) which has massive value to society. Importantly, in terms of an investment, it should be obvious that moving to electric brings massive economic benefits (i.e. makes society wealthier) and that is something investors in Tesla can benefit from, if Tesla can capitalize on all this. This is a big deal I think and not something many seem to comprehend. Not unlike how the industrial revolution allowed for massive economic growth and opportunities to profit.\n\n**Battery Day Sep 2020 -** In Sep 2020, Tesla laid out a vision for their 4680 battery. At the time, I estimated between 2-5 years for most of the improvements to be realized. The tabless part is done. The improvement in the size of the factory is a function of the rest of the parts and is moving along. The dry electrode process is working but needs further improvements to get to needed volume levels. The structural changes to the cars is done. Making a silicon anode... well they dope with silicon and I think moving to their silicon anode is perhaps a while out still. Also, extraction of nickel using first principles I suspect is years out still. With the lithium, seems they are on the path to improving extraction, but not sure. In any case, the improvements they have made headway on (even if they need further work) should help them get to (per their projections... take with a grain of salt) should help them get to 40% cost reduction at the \"battery pack level\" and some decent range increase. Figure another 2 years to these improvements are fully realized and they can move to mass production, but this is very positive for the future. Of course increasing production of 4680's will help translate to a massive energy business on top of the auto business.\n\n**AI -** Every day we are seeing incredible advances in AI. Tesla's key work on AI has revolved around FSD. Basically a system that is being optimized to with a relatively low-powered computing system to be able to rapidly identify the real-world environment and how things around it will interact in order to be able to plan a path to get from A to B. To train this system, you need an uber-expensive, super-duper high-powered and highly optimized computer with its programming along with extensive training data to have a chance at solving this problem. Obviously FSD itself, if and when it works out, is a massive value proposition. Beyond that this AI super-computer has potential to train Optimus, which perhaps is an even bigger value proposition... but why assume things stop there. The AI supercomputers that Tesla is building, can, to the extent Tesla does not need to use the compute capacity themselves, be rented out to others for AI projects. Very simply... If you need a billion dollar computing system to solve a problem quickly, you can either spend a billion dollars, hire the people and spend the time to build such a system or you can go to Tesla and pay them, say, $500 million for a week of compute. You save a half a billion and get compute right away, and Tesla is making $26 billion revenue a year on that computer that cost them $1 billion to build. Obviously real numbers will be based on competition. Before anyone thinks that this is going to be an industry with heavy competition, realize that there are going to be few companies able to build such systems and who have the people to write the best software for them. Each company that does this will be optimized for different uses, meaning that depending on your objective you may go to Google, Tesla, OpenAI, or someone else for the computer you need.\n\n**Next-Gen Vehicle -** This is really the culmination of all the advances in manufacturing vehicles that Tesla undertook. Hard to appreciate at the time but Tesla having trouble finding partners early on to work with and having to make the journey to building more parts themselves has led them to what is going to be the biggest change in how an auto is built (beyond just moving to battery power). Moving to 48V and ethernet, allows for modular construction as you can finish parts and just leave a wire or two hanging out to plug and play to the next module. With traditional manufacturing with 12V and every part needing to be wired to the control system you pretty much need the structure of the vehicle built before you put in the wiring harnesses. Modular construction will allow for much more robotic assembly as you simplify the movements needed to construct a module. Things like a structural battery back also enable this as it allows you mor flexibility in putting your seats on before you attach that to the car (my understanding is if the part is not structural, then building it up before attaching to the structure will result in all sorts of warping making assembly after too difficult. Structural parts should not warp when built as modules). Perhaps the sheet metal skin, as used in the Cybertruck, will allow the structure of the next-gen vehicle to be distributed through modules that are themselves structurally sound before being attached to the other parts of the car. All these underlying technologies are what will help enable the new production process and keep costs well below anything the rest of the industry is close to. I would also note that I really think that EV's are causing the iPhoning of the car world. Meaning, that the perception that people really care about the design of their car and hence choose one model over another, is really a false perception driven by all the choices being sub-par. Offer a car that ticks off all the things you want on a practical level and people will care much less about being unique (in other words, everyone will be fine driving the exact same car, the same way everyone has the exact same looking phone).\n\n**Concluding thoughts** \\- In all these things, I really don't see anyone out there who is really competing or posing a competitive threat to Tesla. Yes, the Chinese automakers, like BYD, are great at mass producing cars and making their LFP batteries, but I don't see these things as actually being very competitive with what Tesla is doing. And even if they are, it will be splitting a massive pie that Tesla will be doing just fine with. Placing a value on all these things is impossible but the potential value here, especially down the line, is trillions. I think the potential value of the energy and auto side of the business without the AI is alone a few trillion. In any case, for those who look at the short-term, I understand it can at times be discouraging as you are not seeing the promised land just yet, but if you focus on what is being done here and how they are building the future it is hard not to be excited. Of course exactly what the future will be and the extent these things work out is unknown, but I am confident with this investment and plan to hold as long as I can.\n\nFYI, I did not bother going into Supercharging, insurance or other things here as many of those things are ancillary or small parts of enabling the bigger things here, but they are big things as well by themselves.\n\nHappy New Year to All!",

      "selftext": "I always knew that Tesla was a significant force in the energy storage sector, but I was under the impression that, given the enormous scope and scale of the potential energy storage market, Tesla's slice of the pie would be somewhat modest. My assumption was that in a field teeming with hundreds of competitors, Tesla might command a market share of around 1%\u2014a small but respectable presence. However, I recently came across some eye-opening data that dramatically shifted my perspective. It turns out that Tesla isn't just a minor player; they hold a staggering TWENTY FIVE percent of the market share in energy storage which is a really big deal.\n\nI mean, the potential market for power storage must be insanely huge.\n\nI'm curious to hear other people's thoughts on this. Does anyone have additional insights or numbers that could paint a more detailed picture of Tesla's role in the energy storage market? How do industry experts view this development, and what predictions do they have for the future trajectory of this market?",

      "selftext": "This might be a bit of a hot take but as an investor in Tesla i'm actually happy about the higher than expected prices.\n\n[At the shareholder meeting in May Elon had announced tesla would aim to make between 250,000 and 500,000 Cybertrucks per year.](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-production-estimates-revealed/)\n\n[Seperately in June there was a leak that Tesla had told suppliers to prepare for 375,000 Cybertruck per year.](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-suppliers-annual-production-rate-forecast/)\n\n[Finally, during the third quarter earnings call Elon seemed to stress the difficutly of ramping a new product as innovative as the Cybertruck while targetting 200,000 units per year for volume production, a target they hope hit in 12-18 months.](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-200000-cybertruck-s-production-per-year/)\n\nThe latest comment from Elon on the Q3 call disappointed me. I thought the goal was eventually to make and sell 500,000 year and hoped that was still the case despite the supplier leak.\n\nHowever given what we know today, it's not surprising why they've dialed down production targets. I suspect they may also still be experiencing a bottleneck from the slower than expected ramp of the 4680 cells.\n\nThat being said i'm actually pleasantly surprised following the announcement of the new, higher, prices.\n\nWhy? Because the numbers are nearly identical.\n\nAssuming the supplier leaks are real, if Tesla can sell 350,000 Cybertrucks at an ASP of \\~$70,000 with gross margins of 20%, the gross annual profits from Cybertruck would total $4.9b.\n\nOn the other hand, if Tesla sold approx. 500,000 Cybertrucks at an ASP of \\~$50,000 with gross margins of 20%, the gross annual profits would total $5b.\n\nSo by increasing their prices Tesla can still earn a similar amount of revenue and profits while making significantly fewer vehicles (and fewer battery cells).\n\nI also suspect that Tesla will be able to ramp production to 500,000 if the demand is there but it looks like they've lowered their expectations.\n\nFurthermore, while alot of people on social media seem to be upset about the higher prices and lower specs, i think there will be plenty of demand.\n\nI've looked into this extensively and am confident that at the current price with the feature set it has, the Cybertruck is very competitive with the Rivian and all trims of Ford Lightning. On an objective basis, i believe that the Cybertruck wins in 95% of categories at a similar price point.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing some of these comparisons you can check out [this thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybertruck/comments/188pgf1/an_updated_chart_of_the_cybertruck_vs_rivian_vs/) which features a chart. The chart does not include all of the differences and i encourage you to look through my comments in that thread to see examples of some of those missing diferences which (in my opinion) are quite big.\n\nThere's also another chart made by u/Xillllix which is being discussed in [another thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/188wcul/updated_80k_ev_truck_comparison_chart/).\n\nNote that the trims of Lightning in those two charts are different, one is for the XLT and the other Lariat. While the XLT + extended range appears cheaper than a dual-motor awd cybertruck by $10k, it comes at the cost of some serious concessions (some of which i discuss in the thread).\n\nAdditionally i'm reassured by some of the other research i've done. Some people might say well but the Cybertruck is expensive relative to ICE trucks and why would someone buy an $80k Cybertruck when they could buy a $40k ICE truck? And to that i say, why don't you ask the consumer.\n\n[This data from Cox Automotive shows the Average Transaction Price accross various brands and segments for vehicles in the USA during the month of July 2023.](https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/July-2023-Kelley-Blue-Book-Average-Transaction-Price-tables.pdf)\n\nThe Average Transaction Price for a Full-size Pickup Truck was $65,595 while for a Small/Mid-size Pickup Truck it was $42,004.\n\nIn general the difference between Full and Mid Size pickups relate to payload and tow rating.\n\nA mid size pickup generally has a tow rating of 7,000lbs versus 10,000lbs+ for a Full Size. Mid size trucks generall have a payload capacity of 1,500lbs or less, while full size trucks are generally rated for 2,000lbs or more. Similarly, full size trucks are larger and have bigger engines, and therefore tend to have higher horsepower, more torque, and lower fuel efficiency.\n\nFor these reasons Tesla's Cybertruck is clearly marketed as, and competing with, Full Size pickups which as i noted above had an ATP of $65,595 last July. At $80,000 Tesla's Dual Motor AWD Cybertruck is not far off when you include the $7,500 IRA tax credit and fuel economy/maintenance savings. Depending on how much you drive, the fuel savings alone could make up the difference (ex-tax credit) in under 2 years (by my estimate).\n\nAnd the market for full size pickup trucks in the USA is large. [In 2023, Hedges and Company are estimating 2.15m full-size pickup trucks to be sold](https://www.google.com/search?q=us+full+size+pickup+truck+sales+per+eyar&sxsrf=AM9HkKkUZLL73yLFRjnosjmefiyT7H6kqA%3A1701718038708&uact=5).\n\nMeanwhile [Tesla is on track to exceed 400,000 Model Y deliveries in 2023](https://twitter.com/TroyTeslike/status/1730086143599722673/photo/1) in the USA alone. [While the market for small Crossover SUVs in the USA was over 2.9m units in 2022](https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2022-us-small-suv-sales-figures/). That means Tesla's compact crossover SUV, the Model Y, could command as much as 13.7% of the small crossover market in the USA in 2023, a figure which may very well make it the best selling SUV in America.\n\nFor the Model 3, Tesla is on track to sell over 200,000 in the USA in 2023.[In 2022 Tesla absolutely dominated the US small Luxury segment with a 41% market share.](https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2022-us-small-luxury-car-sales-figures/) If we include [non luxury compact car sales](https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2022-us-compact-car-sales-figures/), Tesla had approx. 16% of the 2022 US market share of *any engine type* (ICE or EV). To highlight just how impressive this is Tesla sold nearly as many Model 3s in 2022 as Toyota sold Corollas (195k vs 220k respectively) *despite* the [2022 Toyota Corolla starting at $20,425](https://www.cars.com/research/toyota-corolla-2022/) versus the T[esla Model-3's 2022 starting price of $48,490.](https://www.kbb.com/tesla/model-3/2022/)\n\nClearly Tesla is doing something right. And Tesla has been able to acheive this while holding onto more than 50% of the US EV market share as of Q3 2023. Testament to the consumer preference for Tesla's EVs over \"the competition\".\n\nIf there is the same interest and demand for the Cybertruck in the USA as there is for the Model 3 and Model Y, then Tesla should easily be able to sell 300,000 units per year. (15% of 2.15m = 322.5k)\n\nOf course, interest rates are high and demand for big ticket items may be lower than usual right now which could weigh on demand in the short term. On the other hand, Tesla's Cybertruck is so packed with new, novel, and revolutionary features compared to its other products (and to just about everything else in the market)... i would be surprised if interest isn't MUCH higher.\n\nIn fact, some of this interest is already measurable. [A Twitter user posted this 20 hours after the delivery event.](https://twitter.com/alojoh/status/1730859527266877798) After 20 hours, Marques Brownlee's Cybertruck Review video on Youtub had amassed over 5.9M views compared to 5.7M views for his Rivian R1T review video after 2 years, and 8M views for Ford F-150 Lightning after 2 years.\n\n[As of today Marques' Cybertruck Review video has more than 12m views.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxOh12Uhg08)\n\n[The BBC Top Gear Review video has more than 2.4m views.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uefydJUbRhc)\n\n[The Hagerty ICONS episode with Jason Cammissa has over 3.4m views.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6WDq0V5oBg)\n\nAnd [Carwow's Cybertruck Drag Race has 3.3m views.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1v0FNR3-Xc)\n\nTo conclude, i sincerely believe that as production of the Cyebrtruck ramps and people start to see more and more of these in the streets, in their neighborhoods, and at job sites, demand for this product will be insatiable even at the current prices. And as inflation continues to subside the Fed will eventually start cutting interest rates which will make the Cybertruck as well as Tesla's entirely linup more and more affordable, demand will only increase. Some people may not like the look of it at first, but as they see more of them everyday they will grow accustomed to it. As they talk to the owners are the owners give positive feedback it'll only become more compelling. And i also think, over time the product will improve. In 3-5 years i would be surprised if the newest Cybertrucks don't have +50 miles of range compared to today's trims while also selling at lower, more affordable prices.\n\nEdit: i made some edits with the youtube review videos, viewer numbers, and final thoughts.",

Which this one is. \n\nSo\u2026\n\nAs of last Friday \u201cThe Electricians\u201d union joined in the strike against Tesla. Meaning no support, maintenance or repairs will be performed in their workshops or charging stations across the country. \n\nThe strike now includes:\n\nIF Metal - All mechanics in all service centers (including non-Tesla workshops) since November 3rd. \n\nTransport (Truckers Union) - Blockade of the offloading of  Teslas in all Swedish ports since November 17th. \n\nFastighets (Estates) Union - No cleaning services provided in any Tesla facilities since November 17th. \n\nHamnarbetarf\u00f6rbundet (Dock workers Union) - Blockading the handling of all Teslas in all ports since November 17th. \n \nSEKO (Communications and Services Union) - Blocking all mail and packages from\nNovember 20th. \n\nST (Union for government employees) - Blocking all mail and packages from\nNovember 20th. \n\nM\u00e5larna (Painters Union) - Blocking all paint jobs on Tesla cars in over 100 facilities nation wide from November 21st. \n\nByggnads (Construction Workers Union) - Blocking all Tesla related construction work from November 28th. \n\nMusikerf\u00f6rbundet (Musical artists union) - Blocking the use of some music in Tesla cars. \n\nAdding to this polling shows 90% of the Swedes support the strike. All major papers editorials write in support of \u201cthe Swedish model\u201d having a well organized work force with the right to a \u201ccollective agreement\u201d. (All serious employers in Sweden offer this). \n\nThe sentiment on the street if you will is that people rather see Tesla exit the Swedish market than budge on this principle. \n\nThe Tesla brand value or perception is taking a hit\n\nThe Union coffers are filled to the brim and they can keep this up for 500 years, give or take a few. \n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion? Will Tesla agree to the Swedish model? Exit the market? Pretend it\u2019s raining?\n.",

      "selftext": "Alright, it\u2019s that time again where we speculate, ponder, and debate on the question, \u201cHow can Tesla make more money?\u201d\n\nI offer additional thoughts to add to your theses if not already considered. \n\nWith all these Tesla cars with cameras taking video of their environment for FSD training purposes, it is quite possible Tesla can monetize the video stream data to 3rd parties. \n\n1. Government needs a real-time survey of road conditions for weather safety and repair needs? Maybe study road durability over time? *Tesla can do it*\n\n2. Competitive car manufacturers want to know in more granular detail which model and makes drive in certain areas at certain times of the day? *Tesla can do it*\n\n3.  A hedge fund analyst wants to track and extrapolate parking lot foot traffic for an emerging hot startup? *Tesla can do it*\n\n4. A utility company wants to know which trees threaten nearby power lines for preventative trimming? \n\n5. Petroleum company wants to know near real time gas prices?\n\n6.  Apple Maps want even more real time data of new roads to map to compete with Google?\n\n7. Which house in the neighborhood is the odd one out *NOT* putting up holiday decorations so that a company can target ads for decorations on sale?\n\n8. Real estate company wants to know which houses might be showing signs of distress or selling? \u2026 the next evolution of \u201cdriving for dollars\u201d\n\n9. Private Investigations firm wants to track license plate movement?\n\n10.  The list can go on and on. There are a myriad of niche case examples. \n\nTesla cars essentially become roving drones collecting video imaging data to sell for virtually no additional CAPEX.  They begin to overlap as imaging satellites but are on the ground. \n\nIt\u2019s not unlike Apple selling service access of their AirTag network to 3rd parties.\n\nFor edge cases where Tesla traffic is sparse, you can even imagine Tesla having a market place of companies and willing contract drivers doing special \u201cquests\u201d for money with an Apple Store-like service access fee paid to Tesla   ",

Going to the current Model 3 user manual it states the nominal pack voltage is 355V for non-LFP and 345V for LFP. The model Y user manual just states 345V nominal voltage. QED the model Y is only using imported LFP cells in a 108s1p config. \n\nDid Tesla just start importing cells from china in bulk and find some way around the tax credits? Unless CATL built a USA factory and I didn\u2019t hear about it, that seems to be the case. If the tax credit is going to be reduced next year that means they\u2019re importing all cells and claiming some high percentage of value add in the USA to get the full credit. \n\nThis means the 4680 never lived up to the hype, and will die a quiet death of low volume production, as indicated by the recent investor calls saying 4 lines for Cybertruck only, I\u2019m calling it now and saying it\u2019ll only be in some top end CyberTruck and Semi SKUs. \n\nMaybe the threat of 4680 was enough to give them negotiating power so the billions in capex is justified internally. But long term that won\u2019t last and the Chinese giants will ratchet up prices.  I\u2019m sure Tesla Engineering is trying to CYA and claim the 4680 is better than LFP prismatics in performance vehicles, but it\u2019s going to bite them in the end when they\u2019re reliant on competition for the highest value part of the car.",

      "selftext": "BLUF: Toyota strategy to gradually increase battery size in their PHEV may indeed be a good strategy for keeping their margins  throughout 2036\n\nDone some simple math that I want to bring to your attention and stimulate an healthy discussion.\n\nLet's start with some data that we can all collect for the current year, 2023 and do not consider inflation for the values for the next 12 years (2024 to 2036)\n\nToyota PHEV and Tesla ASP are about the same at $47,200\n\nWe know that Tesla cost per vehicle is abut $37500, Tesla margin per car comes at 21% and Toyota margin per car at 18% from their statements.\n\nTesla average battery size per car is about 75 kWh while Toyota PHEV is about 40 kWh.\n\nLet's assume that both companies have a cost per kWh at pack level of $125/kWh and Toyota has an extra cost of about $1200 for the additional ICE engine/power system per car (to match the different margins and battery pack size)\n\nNow let's assume that the cost of battery pack goes down 5% every year while the cost of the ICE component goes down only 1% per year.\n\nNow let's also assume that Toyota and Tesla strategy will keep their margin constants at 2023 levels, with Tesla passing the battery cost reductions to the consumers in terms of lower price while Toyota will pass the same saving to the consumers in terms of increased battery size every year and cost reductions for the ICE component.\n\nKeeping these strategies unchanged until 2036 will have the following results:\n\n~~Assumption of 40 kWh in 2023: Toyota PHEV ASP $46,825 with a 75 kWh battery pack~~\n\n**ADD: Assumption of 13.6 kWh in 2023: Toyota PHEV ASP of $45,500 with a 26 kWh battery pack**\n\n**ADD: As before but faster balance shift from ICE to BEV and reduced margins: Toyota PHEV ASP of $40,000 with a 46 kWh battery pack**\n\nTesla BEV ASP $41,457 with the same 75 kWh battery pack.\n\nToyota buyers will have to face -3.5% to 13% savings/premium AND have an extra ICE engine, and this is not a bad situation to be considering that Toyota brand already demand some price premium due to the know reliability and ability to retain resales value.\n\nIn Summary,  napkin math shows that a lot of what Toyota is saying may have been lost in traslation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Some comment questioned the current average size of the PHEV battery pack at 40 kWh.  and the cost of the ICE component. I redid the math  with 13.6 kWh as suggested and the cost of the ICE component jumped almost to $9000. HOWEVER the overall spread or premium from Toyota PHEV and Tesla in 2036 did not changed much, actually DECREASED\n\n2036 Toyota PHEV with 27 kWh at constant margins will sell for  $45,800 bringing the \"premium down to only 10%\n\nEdit 2: some comments  pointed to further excursions. I reduced the gross margin for Toyota to 10% from 18%, increased the pace at which they add batteries from the current 13.6 kWh and also took into account a much faster reduction of the ICE component (smaller engines). the net result is even more baffling, with Toyota actually undercutting Tesla in 2036 by $1500 or about 3.5%. \n\nBefore start screaming, I am not saying that Toyota will have a better PHEV product n 2036, because PHEV will always have a higher TOC, I am just saying that Toyota strategy of \"surfing\" the price decrease of batteries and leverage on their scale advantage, will give them access to stay with the PHEV model for the next 10 years and be competitive, at least on paper.\n\nSomehow this validates a lot of common thesis that legacy automakers jumped on the electrification way too late and without a good plan for the transition, with Toyota being the exception that at least leverage what they know how to produce at profit - PHEV - to stay in business and harvest the battery tech improvements ",

      "selftext": "This post is both memorializing my thoughts and an attempt to explain Tesla's current pricing strategy as I am reading a lot of criticisms on it which, I think, is related to a misunderstanding of how technology cost decline curves work.\n\nMost of us have heard of Moore's Law which, in a nutshell, is the concept of dropping CPU prices over time. What many don't know is that Moore's Law is really just a subset of a broader observation called Wright's Law.\n\nWright's Law, in a nutshell, is the concept that as more of something is produced it gets cheaper to produce that something. Worded another way, for every doubling of the accumulated production of any good, the price of producing that good drops by some percentage. That percentage is different for different goods but the process has generally been observed for all goods.\n\nWright's Law is why the cost of new technologies tends to drop so rapidly in its early days. Think of LED televisions, cell phones, laptops, photovoltaic solar panels, etc. This isn't is a new concept, it has always been present, for example cars, refrigerators, microwave ovens, etc.\n\nThe reasons for Wright's Law can be complex and abstract but are generally attributed to economies of scale where fixed costs, like design or equipment, can be spread over a larger number of goods. These economies of scale do not just apply to the firm directly producing the final product but also applies to it's entire supply and distribution chain. Even fairly abstract costs like site permitting and employee training get spread over the larger number of produced units. You can almost think of it as \"well the factory has already been built and we have 'recovered' its cost so now every additional unit we produce is effectively 'free' from a factory cost standpoint\". That's kind of a rudimentary way of thinking about economies of scale but might be helpful for non-finance folks.\n\nThis concept is incredibly important to understand how Elon and his team are thinking about pricing and production.\n\nIn order for Tesla to bring the cost of producing vehicles down, Tesla needs to produce as many vehicles as possible in the shortest time possible. Elon thinks long term. He is more concerned with \"maximizing the area under the curve\" than he is about next quarter, or even next year's, profits. The faster they can hit 20 million vehicles per year of production then the faster wright's law kicks in and the more prices fall.\n\nFor this reason, as long as producing a car adds contribution margin, meaning it does not have negative gross margin, then it's beneficial to produce that car in the long term. Once Tesla hits some steady state of production, let's say 20 million vehicles since that's what they're targeting, then sales will stay steady and costs will drop. Gross margins should, in theory, increase from that point forward.\n\nThe above mechanics are basically a certainty. What isn't certain is whether or not other entrants will put downward pressure on what Tesla can charge which eats up their gross margin. This is what Wall St. means when the call Tesla \"just a car company\". They are betting on Tesla's margins converging with other automakers' margins because other automakers will match their cost structure and charge lower prices than Tesla because they would be willing to take lower margins. Tesla would then have to compete with these lower prices by reducing their own prices. This is how competitive markets play out. In my opinion, no legacy automaker has a chance in hell of matching Tesla's cost structure but new entrants or Chinese automakers could.\n\nAt the end of the day, Tesla's mission is to *sell* as many cars as possible and the best way to do that is to *produce* as many as possible. You, as an investor, need to decide whether you think they will be able to produce high margins when they hit steady state sales/production or whether other automakers will match their cost structure and cause margins to converge around some lower percentage.\n\nWould love to hear intelligent thoughts on this.\n\nEdit: in addition to economies of scale, companies also find ways to increase efficiencies in workflows and processes and reduce waste.

      "selftext": "The market has short term memory loss and completely forgetting how significant automakers switching to NACS is. Imagine 1 company owning most gas stations in America since others cannot afford to compete and they sell cars at prices others cannot compete. \n\nI keep seeing people comparing TSLA margins to the other legacy automakers and their conclusion is TSLA has no advantage anymore. What?? The EV margins of other automakers are negative for all except BYD (I think?). If you believe the world will transition to EVs, then you need to compare the EV financials of these companies, and TSLA is untouchable in western markets.\n\nNotice how I didn\u2019t even mention AI here. Those moonshot ideas are icing on the cake. It\u2019s insane that TSLA can afford to pump money into moonshot ideas on top of everything else they are doing when other automakers can\u2019t even break even on EVs. TSLA is truly in a class of their own. \n\nThe future is bright no matter how you slice it. Worst case scenario is the supercharging business slowly starts becoming a major chunk of profit for TSLA so they continue to be valued as a bit more than a car company. Best case scenario is they crack FSD and completely revolutionalize the transportation industry and Tesla becomes a verb people use like Google.  \n\nI\u2019m extremely bullish and transitioned my portfolio to 100% TSLA again like I did when people concluded the sky was falling in December 2022. I\u2019m prepared to bag hold for multiple years if that\u2019s what it takes, but I have a feeling it won\u2019t take long, just like last time and every time.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.",

      "selftext": "Quote by Teslarati:\n\n>As noted by the WSJ, Tesla is installing its Superchargers faster than its rivals, and the company is accomplishing it at a cost that\u2019s 20% to 70% lower.  \n>  \n>The electric vehicle maker has won bids to build out chargers at about 18% of the sites elected by US states using federal dollars. That\u2019s more than any other company, as noted by EV charging analytics firm EVAdoption. Roughly $77 million have reportedly been granted so far, and Tesla has won $8.5 million of the number.\n\nIt's quite an intriguing conundrum, isn't it? Tesla's remarkable efficiency and cost-effectiveness in Supercharger installations are well-documented. But what leaves me scratching my head is the fact that despite their evident prowess in this domain, they've secured only 18% of the bids for federal charger subsidies. This discrepancy warrants a deeper dive into the situation.\n\nTesla's impressive track record, as highlighted in The WSJ, shows that they are deploying Superchargers at a pace that outstrips their competitors. Not only are they faster, but they also manage to do so with a significantly reduced cost burden, somewhere between 20% to 70% lower than their rivals. This raises the question: If they're this efficient, why aren't they winning a more substantial share of the bids?\n\nAccording to data from EVAdoption, Tesla's success in securing these bids surpasses that of any other company in the electric vehicle industry. Out of roughly $77 million in subsidies granted so far, Tesla has managed to secure $8.5 million. While this is certainly a significant amount, it still leaves a substantial portion of the funds unaccounted for, and it's causing some Tesla enthusiasts to question the situation.\n\nOne speculation that has emerged in the Tesla community is the possibility of corruption or favoritism at play, which may explain the discrepancy. However, this is merely conjecture at this point, and we need more information to draw any concrete conclusions.\n\nSo, let's open the floor for discussion. What could be the factors contributing to Tesla's limited success in winning federal charger subsidy bids? Are there regulatory hurdles, competitive dynamics, or other hidden factors that we should consider? Your insights and information could help shed light on this puzzling scenario and provide a clearer picture of the electric vehicle charging landscape.",

      "selftext": "The automotive industry is on the cusp of a monumental transformation, with the advent of Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. As companies like Tesla, Waymo, and traditional automakers continue to push the boundaries of autonomous driving, investors and enthusiasts alike are speculating about the potential impact on market capitalization. In this analysis, we'll delve into the potential market cap growth resulting from the successful deployment of FSD technology, considering both short-term and long-term perspectives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Short-Term Impact: The Immediate Boost\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpon achieving a solved FSD, a surge in market cap is almost inevitable for companies that lead in this technological race. Tesla, a frontrunner in FSD, stands to gain significantly from a successful rollout. This short-term boost can be attributed to several factors:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. \\*\\*Investor Confidence\\*\\*: A proven FSD system would showcase a company's ability to innovate and execute at the cutting edge of technology. This could lead to increased investor confidence and a subsequent uptick in stock prices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. \\*\\*Recurring Revenue Streams\\*\\*: Companies could introduce subscription models for FSD services, creating consistent revenue streams beyond vehicle sales. These streams, when capitalized on effectively, could lead to increased valuation multiples.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. \\*\\*Media and Public Attention\\*\\*: Achieving solved FSD would likely generate massive media coverage, elevating the company's brand and potentially attracting new customers and investors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. \\*\\*Competitive Advantage\\*\\*: The first company to achieve widespread, reliable FSD capabilities would gain a significant competitive edge, possibly causing a shift in market share towards the early adopter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile it's challenging to quantify the exact short-term market cap increase, a reasonable estimate could range from 10% to 30% for leading companies like Tesla, depending on the extent of their technological prowess and the perceived potential of FSD in the market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Long-Term Impact: The Evolution Over 5 Years\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking further ahead, the market cap growth driven by a solved FSD would likely be even more substantial over the next five years. Here are some factors contributing to the long-term impact:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. \\*\\*Mass Adoption\\*\\*: As FSD gains consumer trust and regulatory approvals, more users will adopt the technology, expanding the customer base and potential revenue streams.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. \\*\\*Network Effects\\*\\*: A larger fleet of FSD-enabled vehicles on the road can contribute to data collection and machine learning, further enhancing the capabilities of the technology. This virtuous cycle could cement the leading company's dominance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. \\*\\*New Market Opportunities\\*\\*: FSD could unlock new markets, such as autonomous ride-hailing services and logistics, exponentially increasing revenue potential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. \\*\\*Barriers to Entry\\*\\*: Developing a reliable FSD system requires extensive resources, knowledge, and data. Early leaders could establish significant barriers to entry, deterring competitors from catching up quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsidering these factors, it's conceivable that a company like Tesla, with a successful FSD implementation, could experience a market cap increase of 50% to 100% over a five-year period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Conclusion\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe market cap impact of a solved FSD is poised to be substantial, both in the short and long term. While short-term gains would reflect investor optimism and immediate revenue streams, the long-term impact could be even more transformative, with the potential to reshape the automotive industry and beyond. However, it's important to acknowledge that the FSD landscape is dynamic, with regulatory, technological, and competitive variables at play. As such, these estimates are speculative but grounded in the potential for groundbreaking change that FSD could bring about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?",

      "selftext": " I've seen these comments come up more often lately, essentially drawing parallels between a possible Tesla App Store to Apple's App Store as bullish for the stock, but haven't seen anyone give good reasons why it would significantly impact Tesla's bottom line.\n\nMy view is this: a Tesla App store is nice, but comparing its potential to Apple's App store is ludicrous.\n\n\\-An average American spends under an hour a day in the car, those that WFH even less.\n\n\\-They spend many more hours on their phone (about 4 hrs), but many spend more.\n\n\\-Even when drivers CAN be hands free using FSD, they will likely be on their mobile devices, not on Tesla's car app.\n\n\\-A car-based app store will be limited in the kind of applications it can offer (eg. no fitness apps)\n\n\\-Hardware in cars is not updated as frequently as that of mobile phones. \n\n\\-Limited user base: even if Tesla eventually has 20-50 million install base, that's a drop compared to iPhone's current \\~1.5 B users.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, I think a Tesla App Store is a nothing-burger. It's a nice addition and allows proper support for third party apps, but accounts to nothing more than a value add for the owners, and won't add significant impact to Tesla financials. \n\nCan someone provide sound logic for the opposite view? I am looking to start a spirited debate, and I'd love to be convinced otherwise.\n\nFor disclosure I am huge TSLA bull.",
