As we all know that Tesla FSD is only available to Tesla cars right now, but lets try to look into the future. A future where Tesla FSD is its own entity. Imagine Tesla FSD an independent AI which not only include in cars but also:  \n  \n1.Tesla FSD Airplanes: Imaged the software being installed on aircrafts  and commercial airplanes rides.  \n  \n2.Tesla FSD boats and yachts: Sit back hang out with your friends while Tesla FSD boats drive you around a nice day on the beach.\n\n3. Tesla FSD Robots: Came home from work? Lazy to walk the dogs? Easily route an area for your robots to take the dogs out for a nice walk.\n\n4. Tesla FSD Semi Trucks: We all know that the semi truck driving business is worth over $800 billion in North America, what's stopping company from having a Tesla semi truck with full FSD capability delivering goods and products?\n\nI won't go on, but the possibility are endless.

      "selftext": "TL;DR I work in deep tech, I did not believe proper full self driving can be done, but it's happening for fucking real. v12.3 is genuinely close to the real FSD that Elon has been promising since 2016. There's zero reason why this won't propel $TSLA to trillion-dollar club.\n\nI'd originally bought $TSLA at $20 (adjusted for splits) back in 2018, sold most of it in 2021 (helped me buy a house), and started loading up again since last week. I work in tech, and deeply understand engineering. There were many reasons for selling my shares besides needing cash. For example, I did not believe in the business prospects of Cybertruck, Optimus, solar roof, and similar new products. But by far the biggest reason was I couldn't see FSD happening for real, because of technical limitations. Elon has himself said that Tesla valuation should be close to nothing if FSD does not materialize. Without getting into too many details, I studied the technicalities behind it, and my conclusion was it's just not possible. And it started to feel like Elon is trying to hide that reality and fool people (and himself).\n\nBut, a new technology arrived, and that conclusion became invalid. And I've been amazed how swiftly a large company like Tesla has taken full advantage of it.\n\nWe all know something changed in the technology space since 2022: large neural nets (built upon the transformer architecture) that power ChatGPT, Bard/Gemini, etc. This same technology has started powering Tesla FSD since last couple of versions of it. Similar to how first version of ChatGPT was very good, but with many flaws, all new FSD (with end-to-end neural nets) was very good, but with many flaws. Well, now v12.3 is out, as of last week, and it's now *extremely good, with very few flaws*. It's really just a matter of solving edge cases now; at least as far as launching it in the US is concerned.\n\nI actually believe now there is no technical reason why true FSD cannot be done. In fact I think it'll be fully achieved this year itself. And we all know Elon is going to demo the shit out of this \u2013\u00a0may be even dedicate an entire public event to this by end of year. When that happens there's nothing stopping $TSLA from getting to ATH and beyond. So I'm buying. I highly recommend checking out FSD v12.3 videos on Twitter/YouTube.",

As text-to-video generative model became true with the help of the super powerful H100 microships by Nvidia, you should expect even more sophisticated models using their cutting edge tech H200. Training FSD vehicles won't be mainly dependent on customer vehicles collected data or data collection fleets. A modeler will define the physics rules, a real life scenario, cameras position and many unimaginable criterions. Those generated scenarios will be in millions and will cover all possible scenarios of snowy or slippery roads, to pedestrians trying to cross the street in fog, and many more. The results would be trained models that are trained to behave optimally by training reinforcement learning models.\n\nFSD is closer than ever before!\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNOTE: As I see lot of none sense in the comments section of this post, Do you really think Tesla uses 2 cameras and collection of videos to train their models??? have you ever heard about lidars? do you know what slam stands for? do you know what Kalman or particle filters are?  do you know anything about computer vision? do you know anything about linear algebra, calculus, game and probability theories? do you even know types of ML branches? do you know anything about computational photography? Some would run right away to read introductions and I am pretty sure they won't understand anything of what they are reading. This is why engineers spend years and years of learning in Ivy universities and only very very small number of them get employed in Tesla. You better understand why such engineers are getting paid and why Elon deserves his compensation package. He could smell none-sense right away and this is why I trust his decisions and his plans.I tried in the post to give a hint to regular people about the potentials of Sora and what is coming and by no means I am giving any full picture of how Tesla build their systems.",

      "selftext": "I purchased my first Tesla shares in 2016, right after the announcement event for the Model 3. It was my first investment in something other than an index fund, but after the presentation that evening I couldn't NOT pull the trigger. It was the most optimistic I've ever been about a company. I continued buying more shares every month during all of 2017, 2018, and 2019. Even though I could barely afford it, a big part of every paycheck during those years went to increasing my stake in Tesla. Over time, I built up what was (for me) an absolutely massive position.\n\nThat obviously turned out to be the right move. By 2021, my initial investment had 30x'd, so I cashed out a small portion to buy a Model 3, the same vehicle I had fallen in love with all those years earlier. The cost of the car was tiny compared to the money I had made owning the stock, and the plan was to hold onto the rest until I retired. Then in November 2021, Elon started selling. It feels silly to say this, but I have to admit I felt a bit betrayed. Up until that point, his motto had always been \"first in, last out.\" While that clearly wasn't true anymore, I decided to hang tight.\n\nFuck me, that was a dumb decision. Elon perfectly timed the all time pico top of this thing. Ever since, it's been lower highs and lower lows, year after year, with no end in sight. I could put up with the twitter drama and cringey edgelord shit, but the most recent earnings call was the last straw. I've been listening to those calls for years, and you can tell in his voice Elon is OVER this company. These days, he's obviously more interested in railing against \"illegals\" and poopsocking Diablo than he is about clean energy or even space. He's sure as shit not sleeping on that factory floor ever again. My prediction is he steps down as CEO in the next 12 months.\n\nSo yeah, I'm out. It was a fun ride, but this is where I get off. If Elon's not invested in the company anymore, why should we be?",

He cut prices so fiercely that they can never sell their Teslas even if they wanted to boycott Elon. \n\nNow to lock in the remaining 45%, talking about sustainability is counterproductive. These customers actually love carbon emissions. So, a strategy of \u201cOwn a Tesla to own a lib\u201d can work beautifully.  Bashing DEI, dems and immigrants will get Tesla new customers, who probably would never buy an EV based for rational reasons. Also, if the growth still doesn\u2019t accelerate this year, he can blame the failure on cancel culture by dems. This would most definitely rile up the base and boost sales as his new target customer segment is known to ignore self interest as long as they could spite the libs. If he could get Trump to endorse Tesla, the stock would double in no time. \n\nI say load up on TSLA. It\u2019s becoming a cultural icon, even if technologically and functionally it\u2019s falling behind.  It\u2019s a brand play now just like Coke and Pepsi - what he builds or sells doesn\u2019t matter. He knows it but will investors realize this?\n\nPlease buy as much as you can.

      "selftext": "The following is a far-out take. But in a market where A.I. prospects are pumping like candy, and Tesla has been doing all but, it can't help but make me think why. I know forward PE isn't the greatest but it almost all but doesn't matter too much recently for every other tech company in the market.\n\nElon's rhetoric was giving me the creeps recently.  He's usually very optimistic despite headwinds.He just seemed off when he threatened to take A.I. elsewhere, out from Tesla. That alone gave me red flag vibes. Even if it isn't true it may be hinting at another underlying issue to shareholders who are carefully paying attention.\n\nI'm not implying that he's trying to warn us in some conspiratorial matter, but rather a symptom of a underlying situation, and maybe it's his subconscious way of verbalizing out loud to those listening, \"sell if you're trying to time it\"\n\nSo what's the underlying issue? Elon still having a twitter debt leveraged over his shares - which I speculate he will eventually get margin called on again, sometime this year. Firms know this which may be why they are avoiding it so they can buy more for cheaper. After all he HAS to sell those shares, unless someone can confirm otherwise. If firms are going to bid big chunks of Elon's shares over the better half of a week, why would they buy them for more? They would want to bid for as little as possible. They can just avoid buying in the meantime and keep volume low.\n\nAnd It's exactly what they did last time. Elon had to sell for cheap. It's business, they know who's leveraged and they take advantage if possible. And maybe Elon's a big enough fish to hunt here. Perhaps it's the real reason why Elon is trying to call on more shares. \n\nThis concludes my tin-foil hat theory and I think this is closer to the truth than something like a high PEG ratio regarding last few month's price action. Again, it's been a full-on buy risk market since November and Tesla had no problem trading for higher last year.",

      "selftext": "I listened to the earnings call, and Musk stated many times that they are heavily susceptible to the interest rate. However, I checked some numbers, Majority of the auto brands sales were up from 2022 to 2023. In the US, total auto sales went up 10% in 2023. The sales number does not seem to be affected by the interest rate a lot in 2023. If that was the case, I would expect the total auto sales went down. So I am not sure why Elon Musk thinks that Tesla was affected by the interest rate. Does anyone know?",

It is not revolutionizing anything in my life. It\u2019s just a nice smooth quiet ride with some cool features that I like. \n\nFor me, owning a Tesla makes me less likely to buy the stock because I see it as a car company and not a technology panacea. P/E of 60 makes zero sense if it is indeed a car company (I get the argument against that). I think most of Elon\u2019s ideas are distractions and will be about as successful as the Boring Co.

      "selftext": "My pricing theory in a nutshell - most things have been \"priced in\" around the $700bn-$1tn market cap levels ($1tn is about $315 a share).  Tesla was in the $1tn club at one point in time, but with a lot of other things pulling back - plus higher interest rates certainly impacting some aggregate demand - they are not.  I believe they can get back into the $1tn club again - but not off of the current pipeline, plus reasonable overall unit sales growth.\n\nDespite what some YouTube'r who just loaded up on shares at the $100 dip might think *based on their buy price* and how Tesla is clearly going to $1,000 a share - that's not how markets work.  Or rather, I should say that's not how institutional advisors think.  They don't think in share prices, because they're buying blocks in huge sizes.  So they look at market cap.  More specifically, they start looking at market caps of other companies and ponder - is Tesla worth more than Microsoft?  Than Apple?  Than Saudi Aramco?  Then all of those combined?  (because that's what the \"*Tesla shares to $2,500!*\" people on YT are effectively saying)\n\nIMO, no.  At least not on a short(ish) time horizon.\n\n2024 will be the year of FSD as the best possible mover for the stock.  It's not Robotaxi, because Robotaxi is 100% dependent on FSD.  And it's not more sales of 3, Y, etc.  Power could move them but it will be slow.  A $25k model 2 could really move the needle, though - but since we don't know anything more than rumors and speculation on that ... IMO it's all on v12 this year for Tesla.  It gives them many more upsell (higher margin) opportunities on new cars, and a bunch of upgrade sales opportunities to the existing fleet.  Plus licensing opportunities to every other automobile manufacturer on the planet.\n\nWhy do I think(/hope) v12 - all neural nets - will be different?  Simply because we've seen v11 hit a limit on what I can do.  For those of you driving on it, you probably have some scenarios like this one:\n\n* Driving down expressway, in the right lane.  An entrance ramp starts to come in from your right side.  The painted line on the right hand side suddenly moves way out to the right to accomodate the entrance merge lane ... so what does your Tesla do?  What it's basic IF-THEN-ELSE hand-coded logic tells it to -- \"*you need to keep in the center of the lane!*\" so it splits the huge lane, which is stupid and nothing a human would ever do, and is frankly unsafe.\n\nNow ... v11 is *way better* at this than it used to be, but it still makes this mistake regularly enough - at least for me.  Why?  Because the hard-coded logic has a rough order of rules.  First - \"*keep car inbetween lane lines...*\" but then they have to build in exception after exception after exception - \"...*unless there is an entrance ramp coming in from the right in which case keep a reasonable distance off of the left line.\"* etc. etc. over and over again.  And you just can't code out all the edge cases by hand.\n\nSo neural nets will *hopefully* be the answer.  Neural nets will look at all the driving and say \"*well, the right lane line moved wayyyyyy out, but the humans never move towards it so I won't either*\" and just keep on its merry way.\n\nI do not think v12 out-of-the-box will be \"Robotaxi ready\" levels of capability.  I still question whether that's even really feasible.  But I do think that v12 has a chance in the initial drop to be at least close to v11, maybe on-par, maybe slightly better.  And then the thing to watch will be how quickly it advances.  Once they know where the disengagements come, they can figure out what the net doesn't understand, find video clips of that location being handled properly, and stuff them into the training model.  It will be so unbelievably easy - based on GPS and car telemetry data for Tesla to do this.  \"Ah, v12 gets a lot of disengagements at the 4-way intersection of State & Main in Anytown, US ... let's go find a bunch of non-FSD drives though that same spot, filter for the ones that look like '5-Star Uber drivers' (Elon's phrase) and stuff them into the training dataset...\"\n\nBTW, Tesla has quite a \"moat\" in this regard given their global fleet size.\n\nIf you see v12 capabilities advance *quickly* across the 2nd, 3rd, 4th wide releases -- then I think Tesla absolutely makes it back into the $1tn club (>$315 a share) in 2024.  Even if Tesla has to implement something like much more stringent weather condition limitations based on the video clips they're curating.  I'd much rather have something that gets near-close to being a Robotaxi but only on clear sunny days ... than something that muddles through with moderate (but not Robotaxi levels) of competency anytime day or night.\n\nConversely, if the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th releases bomb ... Tesla might just be stuck here bouncing around below $1tn for quite some time.\n\nYMMV.  Good luck with your positions.  Keep an eye on v12, forget about robotaxi or optimus for now.\n\nEDIT:  Damnit.  Think(/**hope**).  Grrrr...",

NOTE: none of the replies will be considered as financial advice and will not be used to make trades! \n\nIn 6 months time, a 70k loan will need to be paid back to a bank in it's entirety. There will be no penalties for early repayment and small chunks can also be paid within the 6 months without charge. Interest is 500 per month, totalling 3k over the 6 months period. \n\n500 shares of TSLA owned (avg cost price 18 per share). Approx 34% capital gains taxes upon sale. \n\nWhat would be the best strategy to maximise gains in the next 6 months? \n\nInitially the plan was to sell at around 260 but the stock has tanked so much lately. It's obviously a massive risk to wait since the price could keep dropping. \n\nWould it make sense to sell covered calls (maybe monthlies) to capitalise on the situation? E.g. Higher strike price of 240/250? Happy to get called as the shares will need to be sold anyway. \n\nThanks a lot for reading, looking forward to reading everyone's opinions and strategies!",

Loss of technology halo: Failing to get even 50% of promised standard range for CT has tarnished Tesla\u2019s image as a leader in battery innovation. Its late and mediocre arrival behind R1T and R1S is hurting the brand.\n\n2. Competition: In higher end luxury, the rich folks in Bay Area prefer BMW, Mercedes and Porsche now as every Tom, Dick and Harry has a Tesla after last year\u2019s price cuts. It\u2019s no longer an exclusive product that people want to show off, especially after Elon-Twitter saga. On the lower end, BYD is beating Tesla wherever it chooses to compete. The BYD Seal beat Tesla even in a drag race, which used to be a key bragging rights for Tesla. \n\n3. Network commoditization: Tesla has given away its supercharger network advantage by opening it up to everyone. New car buyers won\u2019t consider that as a benefit anymore. \n\n4. FSD risk:  Given the above three problems, Elon will likely make an unforced error by rushing FSD, which isn\u2019t ready! It still can\u2019t see speed bumps (at least in my neighborhood) and freaks out when a biker tries to split lanes on the freeway (legal in California). If FSD is declared live, there\u2019s a huge possibility of a freak accident to shut down the whole thing like Cruise\u2019s recent mishap!\n\n5. Cold weather. The Chicago situation is getting national limelight and may stall penetration of Tsla beyond the Sunny states.\n\nWhat else should be on the list?\n\nEdit: added #5\nEdit 2 (post earnings): kicking myself for not switching from Bull to Bearish position when I did this DD (Tsla was $240+!!!)

Having become China\u2019s best-selling auto brand at home, BYD Co. (which stands for Build Your Dreams) has now surpassed Tesla to be the world\u2019s biggest maker of electric vehicles. In the mini-documentary How BYD Took Tesla\u2019s Crown, Bloomberg Originals explores how a company that started out as a battery manufacturer transformed itself into the global king of EVs.\n\nCritical to BYD\u2019s success has been vertical integration. Instead of relying on other companies for parts, BYD managed to crack the code of producing EVs cheaply in part by making most of its own components. The company is able to offer a wide range of affordable EVs at low prices, maximizing sales (if not revenue) while expanding its footprint in new markets.\n\nAfter leapfrogging the US, South Korea and Germany, China now rivals Japan for the global lead in passenger car exports. And some 1.3 million of the 3.6 million vehicles shipped from the mainland as of October were electric. In a sector still dominated by big names like Toyota, Volkswagen and General Motors, companies like BYD are beginning to make serious inroads.\n\nTo be sure, BYD has had a lot of help from the Chinese government and even Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway has been a key investor. And its aspirations aren\u2019t limited to relegating Elon Musk and Tesla to second place. BYD is building factories in Europe, Latin America and across Asia as part of a broader effort to expand sales across these continents, and its cars and buses are popping up in cities all over the world\u2014even in the US. As the world increasingly turns from combustion to electric-powered vehicles, the Chinese automaker is positioning itself to take on all comers.",

The company delivered 484,507 units in the fourth quarter, including 461,538 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.\n\nTesla does not break out sales by individual brand or region, which makes estimates of bestselling vehicles more difficult to compute, but one electric vehicle site is predicting a new record set by the company.\n\nData from CleanTechnica revealed the Model Y is likely the bestselling electric vehicle of all time based on the fourth quarter report from Tesla.\n\nThe media site predicted Tesla has sold a total of 2,493,657 Model Y units since the vehicle first began deliveries in March 2020. This figure would pass the estimated 2,295,187 Model 3 vehicles delivered by Tesla.\n\nTesla beats an old Tesla record, continuing the company's legend as the leader in electric vehicles.\n\nWhy It's Important:  \nSelling two million electric vehicles is something many automotive companies would dream of and Tesla has done it twice with two different vehicle models.\n\nAlong with being the bestselling electric vehicle of all time, the Model Y could end up being one of the bestselling vehicles in the U.S. and globally for all of 2023, regardless of vehicle type.\n\nBenzinga reported recently the Model Y was likely to end the year as the bestselling vehicle in Europe. Data from Norway recently released saw the Model Y the top-selling vehicle in the country with an 18.2% market share of the new car market.\n\nIf the Model Y is the bestselling vehicle in Europe for 2023, it would mark several firsts, including the first electric vehicle, first midsize car and first non-European car in the modern era to take home the yearly honors.\n\nIn the U.S., pickup trucks dominated the list of top-selling vehicles. The Model Y ended 2022 as the sixth bestselling vehicle in the U.S. with a 32.4% year-over-year increase in units sold.\n\nFinal estimates are not out and with Tesla not releasing individual vehicle model figures or regional data, estimates could be off on just how well the Model Y sold in 2023.\n\nTSLA Price Action:  \nTesla shares trade Thursday up 1% at $240.91 versus a 52-week trading range of $101.81 to $299.29. Shares of Tesla are up 113% in the last year.",

The EV market leader reported record vehicle deliveries for the year (1.808 million), representing a 38% increase compared to 2022. The stock ended the year up by triple-digits. That was fantastic news for those who bought in when sentiment was at its most bearish last winter.\n\nFor TSLA\u2019s longtime skeptics, this is a horrendous turn of events. Contrary to bearish predictions, this high-flying stock remained unaffected by factors like inflation, interest rates, and competition. Despite challenges, Tesla may prove its skeptics wrong in the new year. However, whether that means you should buy and hang tight today is another question entirely.\n\nTesla stock remains far from its past all-time high. As you may recall, during the height of \u201cEV stock mania\u201d in 2021, TSLA reached prices north of $400 per share. In hindsight, one can argue that shares went up too far, too fast two years ago.\n\nThat said, thanks to several catalysts, TSLA stock could make a big leap back towards near its high-water mark. For one, if the much-awaited pivot on interest rates by the Federal Reserve ends up taking shape this year, this may have a tremendous impact on re-accelerating electric vehicle demand growth in the U.S.\n\nAlso, over in China, the world\u2019s largest EV market, and home to Tesla\u2019s largest production facility, government stimulus efforts could indirectly boost EV demand. Demand has been affected by China\u2019s weak post-Covid recovery. A demand resurgence may help counter a key headwind for Tesla (rising local competition).\n\nThat\u2019s not all. The hitting of new milestones with its autonomous driving technology is something else that would drive further gains for TSLA. So too, would any progress with Tesla\u2019s efforts to bring a low-priced EV to market, as InvestorPlace\u2019s Thomas Niel argued last month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVolatility Around the Corner?\n\nSeveral factors could make 2024 a strong year for TSLA stock. Proceed with caution. More share volatility could come soon. TSLA ended 2023 on a high note because of the market\u2019s strong performance.\n\nStocks, especially growth stocks, rallied during November and December, thanks to optimism about the aforementioned possible \u201cFed pivot.\u201d\n\nHowever, doubts about when this pivot will happen (or even if it will happen at all this year) could be creeping back up. This could result in a rocky stock market, and another short-term move lower for TSLA.\n\nBeyond negative price moves driven by the broad market\u2019s movements/macro news, concerns about Tesla itself may also drive a sharp pullback for shares. For instance, as I discussed last week, negative news about the Cybertruck could dampen bullishness for TSLA.\n\nWhen Tesla next releases earnings on Jan. 24, investors may look to certain aspects of the earnings report (such as further margin declines, or less-stellar full-year sales outlook) as excuses to bail on the stock. With all this in mind, in contrast to last year, TSLA\u2019s price performance could experience a rough start.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBottom Line: Wait for a Better Time to Buy\n\nTesla\u2019s long-term prospects remain fairly bright. Morgan Stanley analysts suggest diversifying into self-driving technology licensing and high-margin products/services for potential earnings growth of 27% between now and 2030.\n\nIf this bull case pans out, shares still have considerable room to run. This suggests holding onto a TSLA position, if it\u2019s currently in your portfolio. It also suggests eventually adding some to your portfolio if you don\u2019t already own it, but bear in mind there\u2019s no rush to do so.\n\nIn short, as much could knock it lower before it surges even higher, wait for weakness before initiating/adding to a TSLA stock position.\n\nTSLA stock earns a B rating in Portfolio Grader.",

Tesla's avid customer base and its history of innovation and bucking long odds have also helped the company earn an unusually high earnings multiple for an automaker.\n\nTesla finished 2023 with a price-to-earnings ratio of 80 and a market cap of nearly $800 billion. The stock jumped 102% in 2023, but that performance was more due to excitement over artificial intelligence (AI) rather than the performance of the business itself, which featured slowing revenue growth and declining profits as the company cut prices on its vehicles to gain market share in an increasingly competitive electric-vehicle (EV) environment.\n\nHeading into 2024, Tesla bulls are probably expecting another winning year from the stock as interest rates are expected to fall, rival automakers such as GM and Ford are pulling back on EVs, and Tesla just hit its full-year 2023 delivery guidance of 1.8 million vehicles. In 2024, the company should also benefit from the recent launch of the new Cybertruck and, potentially, new developments in artificial intelligence as Tesla is expected to eventually allow its vehicles to be driven autonomously and to develop a fleet of robotaxis that will be designed solely as ride-sharing vehicles without steering wheels or other components that a human driver would use.\n\nOne question on a lot of investors' minds is if Tesla will reclaim its status as a trillion-dollar company. That would require a 27% gain this year. That would be reasonable, but it's certainly not guaranteed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat to expect for Tesla in 2024\n\nTesla hasn't yet issued guidance for 2024, but we can get a sense of where the company is headed in 2023 based on its recent results.\n\nTesla finished the fourth quarter with 484,507 deliveries, 461,538 of which were Model 3 and Y vehicles. For the year, it delivered 1.809 million vehicles, just over its target of 1.8 million, and it produced 1.846 million.\n\nIn 2020, Tesla announced a goal of increasing its production by a compound annual growth rate of 50%, and the company fell a bit short of that goal in 2023, though Elon Musk had previously stressed that that was a long-term average figure and not a target it will hit each year. Deliveries in 2023 rose 38%, while production was up 35%.\n\nThat's not a problem for Tesla in and of itself, but its sequential production growth in 2023 has been modest as well. It delivered 423,000 vehicles in the first quarter, meaning production grew just 15% from Q1 to Q4.\n\nPredicting the company's deliveries in 2024 is difficult, but it's likely to fall short of 2.7 million, which would be its 50% target. The company is expected to produce up to 150,000 Cybertrucks, but it doesn't have any new vehicles or factory openings to support that growth. Tesla did have a substantial amount of scheduled downtime at its factories in 2023, which could allow for more production in 2024, but most estimates call for 2 million to 2.5 million deliveries this year, which would represent solid, but not outstanding, growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan AI save the day?\n\nVehicle deliveries are likely to be the primary determinant of revenue and profit for Tesla in 2024, but investors will also be focused on developments in artificial intelligence. Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, for example, expects Tesla stock to gain roughly 700% by 2030 as robotaxis emerge as its primary revenue stream, and the company's bipedal autonomous robot, Optimus, also has the potential to invent a new category in AI.\n\nTesla has thus far played coy with its AI projects, giving investors little information on when its developments might be monetized or when full self-driving will be fully available, but any progress on that front could juice the stock in 2024.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill Tesla cross the $1 trillion mark?\n\nTesla has the potential to grow revenue and profits by 27% or more in 2024, but in order for the stock to cross the trillion-dollar mark, it will have to continue earning a premium from investors, which means it will either have to exceed analyst expectations or make significant progress in AI.\n\nOtherwise, the stock will be dependent on the same bullish sentiment that propelled it higher in 2023. While that could persist, over the long term, the company will need to deliver real profit growth and technological innovation for the stock to keep moving higher, as much is still expected from Tesla at its current valuation.",

He expects fourth-quarter core auto gross margins to be above the third quarter\u2019s 16.3% due to the 11% higher volume in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe\u00a0Future Fund Active ETF\u00a0(NYSE:FFND), the flagship exchange-traded fund of Black\u2019s Future Fund, has Tesla as its second-biggest holding.\n\nFor those cranky about\u00a0$TSLA\u00a0underperformance this morning let's get real:\u00a0$TSLA\u00a0had a big run in 2023 (+102% vs NDX +54%) and all tech is getting hit today on concerns the Fed may not be as aggressive in cutting rates as some had hoped.\n\nVolume Growth To Slow?\u00a0Black said he expects Tesla to guide to 2024 deliveries of at least 2.2 million units, in line with the consensus estimate. The company typically comments about delivery targets on its quarterly earnings calls. The\u00a0Elon Musk-led company will release fourth-quarter results on Jan. 24.\n\nThe fund manager\u2019s deliveries outlook suggests 22% year-over-year growth, the slowest since 2013, the first full year after Tesla began delivering its Model S EVs in June 2012.\n\nThe growth, according to the fund managers, would be slow by Tesla standards but is \u201dquite achievable,\u201d going by fourth-quarter strength in China and the \u201chalo effect\u201d expected from the Cybertruck, which was commercially launched in late November.\n\nThe slowdown is a function of an\u00a0uncertain economic and monetary policy outlook\u00a0that has been weighing down on demand, competitive threat, and a lack of budget model EV.",

What Wall Street Is Watching Now.**\n\nBarron's \u00b7 2024/01/03 04:58 GMT-05:00\n\nTesla's fourth-quarter delivery and production numbers were good, but Wall Street doesn't sit still. The focus has already moved on to 2024 profit margins and shipments.\n\nThe electric-vehicle company delivered a better-than-expected 485,000 cars and trucks in the final three months of the year. Tesla shares fell six cents to $248.42, but that was a tremendous result considering the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.6%. Apple shares fell 3.6% following a downgrade from Barclays, and stock in Rivian Automotive stock plunged 10% to $21.10 after the company reported its own solid delivery figures.\n\nIn 2023, \"Rivian fixed production, began its journey to scale in earnest, and started to beat/raise its guidance targets,\" wrote Canaccord analyst George Gianarikas in a Tuesday report. \"It ended the year with a bang, exceeding its production target by about 3,000. Deliveries were also in line with consensus and higher than our estimates, leaving us mildly confused by \\[the\\] stock reaction.\"\n\nInvestors just weren't in the mood to buy shares to start the new year. A second headwind is that Rivian shares were up about 30% in the month coming into the delivery report.\n\nGianarikas rates Rivian stock at Buy and has a target of $30 for the price. He also rates Tesla shares at Buy, with a $267 price target.\n\nHe was impressed by Tesla's delivery performance too, noting that the company shipped more than 1.8 million vehicles in 2023, as it had told investors to expect, despite rising interest rates and a slowing economy.\n\nStill, Gianarikas said he is \"riddled with more questions than answers.\" At the top of the list is whether 2024 expectations for deliveries of about 2.2 million units are low enough. Then there is whether automotive gross margins have hit bottom at about 16% in the third quarter, down about 10 percentage points from a year earlier, as a result of Tesla's price cuts. And given that Tesla isn't expected to launch a new vehicle model in 2024, can investors get excited about Optimus the robot, and advancements in Tesla's driver assistance software?\n\n\"More important than today's delivery news is a crucial earnings call that awaits,\" he added. That call is slated for Jan. 24.\n\nTD Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne believes Tesla needs to forecast deliveries of about 2.2 million vehicles on the January call to keep investors happy. He rates Tesla shares Hold and has a $200 price target for the stock.\n\nNew Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu rates shares Buy and has a $300 price target. He wrote after the delivery report that gross profit margins should remain \"under pressure\" in the fourth quarter, but sees them improving to about 19% in 2024.\n\nOverall, Wall Street is a bit less upbeat. It expects the fourth-quarter gross profit margin, excluding regulatory credits, to come in at about 16%, similar to the third quarter, and improve by about one or two percentage points in 2024.\n\nThe earnings conference call is the next big deal for the stock. Comments CEO Elon Musk makes about further price cuts and interest rates will go a long way to answering some of the lingering questions Wall Street has after a record quarter for shipments.\n\nTesla stock was down 2.9% in early trading Wednesday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite had both fallen 0.5%.",

      "selftext": "**The Road to $1000: Tesla's Multifaceted Rise Fueled by Cars, Energy, AI, and a Devoted Community**\r  \n\r  \nIn the ever-evolving landscape of the stock market, few companies have captured the imagination of investors and enthusiasts alike as Tesla has. The electric vehicle (EV) pioneer led by Elon Musk has become a symbol of innovation, sustainability, and resilience. Despite facing media scrutiny and market volatility, there are compelling reasons to believe that Tesla's stock price could reach $1000 within the next 12 months, driven by factors ranging from their groundbreaking cars and energy solutions to their advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and a steadfast community support in the face of mainstream media challenges.\r  \n\r  \nDominance in the Electric Vehicle Market:\r  \nTesla's electric vehicles have revolutionized the automotive industry. With a strong focus on design, performance, and sustainability, Tesla has captured a significant share of the growing EV market. The company's commitment to innovation, exemplified by the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y, positions Tesla as a leader in the transition from traditional combustion engines to electric power.\r  \n\r  \nEnergy Solutions and Sustainability:\r  \nBeyond electric vehicles, Tesla has been at the forefront of renewable energy solutions. The acquisition of SolarCity and the development of solar panels and energy storage solutions showcase Tesla's commitment to a sustainable energy future. As the world shifts towards cleaner and greener alternatives, Tesla's comprehensive approach to energy, from generation to storage, gives it a strategic advantage in a rapidly changing market.\r  \n\r  \nArtificial Intelligence Integration:\r  \nTesla's commitment to AI is not confined to self-driving capabilities; it extends to the overall user experience. The Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, despite facing regulatory hurdles, remains a cutting-edge feature that positions Tesla as a pioneer in AI integration within the automotive industry. As AI technology continues to mature, Tesla is well-positioned to leverage its expertise for further advancements, providing a competitive edge.\r  \n\r  \nElon Musk's Vision and Media Backlash:\r  \nElon Musk, the enigmatic CEO of Tesla, has been the driving force behind the company's success. Despite facing criticism from mainstream media, Musk's vision and leadership have resonated with a growing community of supporters. Tesla's stock has shown resilience in the face of media challenges, with a dedicated user base that sees beyond the noise, focusing on the long-term potential of the company.\r  \n\r  \nCommunity Support and Grassroots Movement:\r  \nTesla has cultivated a passionate community of supporters, often referred to as \"Tesla fans\" or \"Elon stans.\" This grassroots movement has not only contributed to Tesla's brand loyalty but has also served as a counterforce against negative media narratives. As more users advocate for Tesla, share positive experiences, and engage in social media campaigns, the company benefits from organic, word-of-mouth marketing that transcends traditional advertising.\r  \n\r  \nConclusion:\r  \n\r  \nTesla's journey to a $1000 stock price within the next 12 months appears to be grounded in the company's multifaceted approach to innovation, sustainability, and community support. The electric vehicle market's continued expansion, Tesla's leadership in energy solutions and AI, coupled with the unwavering support of a devoted community, collectively contribute to a compelling case for Tesla's continued success in the stock market. As the world embraces a more sustainable and technology-driven future, Tesla stands at the forefront, ready to drive change and redefine the automotive and energy industries.",

Well done SpaceX\n\nStage 1, the heavy booster, all engines run to separation, a complete success, well done. This is as far as any other rocket in history has gotten. A problem with the boost back portion, may be a software fix. Still a massive success.\n\nStage 2,  Hot staging happened, fabulous. All engines running after staging, great. So there turns out that there was some problem with the O2 venting. This will be fixed. \n\nOverall, the test was a massive success. They could launch another rocket tomorrow because Stage 0 worked.

Tesla's introduction of a Standard Range variant for the Model S and Model X has been highlighted on its online configurator. An airport in a southern Chinese city recently restricted Tesla vehicles from parking due to \"confidentiality concerns\" associated with Tesla's \"sentry mode.\" Tesla responded on Weibo, emphasizing the offline storage of Sentry Mode data and its commitment to data localization in China, aligning with the country's 2021 automobile data protection measures. As Tesla prepares to introduce its Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature in China, it faces challenges related to data isolation and localization.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Analysis:\\*\\*  \n\nTesla's data security concerns in China can influence its position in a crucial market.

      "selftext": "## 1. **Tesla Is Cutting Prices Again. Why It\u2019s Driving Up Concern.**\n\n**Summary:**  \nTesla has announced another round of price cuts for its vehicles in China. The company has reduced the price for certain Model 3 sedans by 8,000 Yuan (~$1,100) and for the long-range and performance versions of the Model Y by 14,000 Yuan (~$2,000). This move has raised concerns about potential price wars and the overall demand for electric vehicles in China.\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe price reduction can be seen as a strategic move to capture a larger market share in the world's largest market for new cars. However, it also raises questions about the sustainability of such aggressive pricing strategies, especially in the face of growing competition. The price cut might be a response to similar moves by competitors like Zeekr.\n\n**Key Data:**\n- Model 3 price reduction: 8,000 Yuan (~$1,100)\n- Model Y price reduction: 14,000 Yuan (~$2,000)\n\n---\n\n## 2. **A Pain in the Neck: Elon Musk and Tesla\u2019s Revolving C-Suite**\n\n**Summary:**  \nTesla's CFO, Zach Kirkhorn, has stepped down, highlighting the ongoing challenges Elon Musk faces in establishing a stable senior leadership team. Kirkhorn's departure underscores the broader pattern of high-level turnover at Tesla.\n\n**Analysis:**  \nKirkhorn's departure might raise concerns among investors about the stability of Tesla's leadership. His role in balancing Musk's visionary approach with pragmatic financial management was crucial for the company. The transition might lead to short-term volatility, but the long-term impact will depend on how seamlessly his successor fills the role.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Tesla\u2019s New CFO Is Known as VT. The Rest Is a Mystery.**\n\n**Summary:**  \nVaibhav Taneja, known internally as VT, has been appointed as Tesla's new CFO. Despite his significant position, Taneja has maintained a low profile both within and outside Tesla.\n\n**Analysis:**  \nTaneja's appointment indicates Musk's trust in promoting from within. His background in accounting and finance suggests a focus on fiscal discipline and cost management. However, his relatively low profile might mean a period of adjustment as he takes on a more public-facing role.\n\n**Key Data:**\n- First Tesla job: Assistant corporate controller\n- Value of Tesla stockholdings: About $26 million\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK funds unload another $19 million in Tesla\u2019s stock**\n\n**Summary:**  \nCathie Wood's ARK Investment continues to sell Tesla shares, with the latest sale amounting to $18.8 million. This move is in line with ARK's trend of reducing its Tesla holdings over the past few months.\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe consistent selling of Tesla shares by ARK might influence other investors' perceptions of Tesla's stock. It could be seen as a lack of confidence in Tesla's future prospects or simply a portfolio rebalancing strategy by ARK.\n\n**Key Data:**\n- Number of Tesla shares sold: 76,425\n- Sale value: $18.8 million",

There had been speculations in the past year that Kirkhorn might be the successor to Musk. The exact reason for Kirkhorn's departure remains undisclosed, but comments from Musk suggest that it might have been due to burnout.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe departure of a key executive, especially the CFO, can lead to short-term volatility in the stock price. Investors may be concerned about the transition and the potential impact on the company's financial strategies. The market's perception of this departure, especially if it's seen as a negative sign or if there are rumors about internal issues, could affect investor sentiment.\n---\n\n## 2. **Tesla introduces mobile Megacharger for Semi in Las Vegas**\n\n**Summary:**\nTesla recently unveiled a Megacharger in Las Vegas, which was later identified as a mobile Megacharger when it was packed up and relocated.

      "selftext": "## 1. Tesla Readies Launch Of \u2018Highland\u2019 Model 3 \u2014 But Price In Question\n\n**Summary:**Tesla is set to unveil the next iteration of the Model 3, termed the \"Model 3 Highland.\" Amidst the buzz about the car's features, the primary focus remains its pricing. Recent filings indicate Tesla's registration of the Model 3 Highland in China. Speculations suggest potential updates like new headlights, the introduction of Hardware 4.0 self-driving tech, and cost-effective battery solutions.\n\n**Analysis:**The Model 3 Highland's pricing strategy will be pivotal for Tesla's market penetration, especially in competitive markets like China. Elon Musk's emphasis on affordability, coupled with recent measures like the introduction of extended loan periods, underscores Tesla's strategy to cater to a broader customer base. The introduction of a competitively priced model could significantly boost Tesla's global market share.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Expected changes: New headlights, Hardware 4.0 self-driving tech, cost-effective battery tech.\n* Previous statement by Musk: Potential for a $25,000 fully autonomous EV.\n* Recent Model 3 pricing: As low as $37,420 in California.\n\n## 2. Tesla Stock Has Had a Lousy Week. Here Is What Could Turn It Around.\n\n**Summary:**Tesla's stock has witnessed a decline this week, dropping by 2.7%. This dip is partly attributed to the broader market downturn and Nvidia's stock performance. However, specific factors, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's investigation into Tesla's power steering issues, have also played a role.\n\n**Analysis:**While market fluctuations are a common influence on stock prices, Tesla-specific news, especially regulatory investigations, can have a pronounced impact due to the company's high profile. Positive developments, like potential partnerships or product deliveries, can act as catalysts for stock recovery. Investors and stakeholders should closely monitor Tesla's forthcoming announcements and strategic moves.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Tesla's stock decline this week: 2.7%.\n* Broader market performance: S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite dropped by 1.8% and 2.5%, respectively.\n* Nvidia's stock decline: 4.8% this week.\n\n## 3. Tesla's Meeting with India: New Details Emerge\n\n**Summary:**Recent interactions between Tesla and Indian government officials have intensified speculations about Tesla's entry into the Indian market. Meetings with high-level officials, including the Prime Minister and Commerce Minister, hint at potential governmental support for Tesla's market entry.\n\n**Analysis:**India, being one of the world's largest automotive markets, presents a significant opportunity for Tesla. Successful negotiations and a smooth market entry could substantially enhance Tesla's global sales and presence. The leasing of office space in Pune further indicates Tesla's commitment to establishing a foothold in India.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Tesla executives' meeting: With Nivruti Rai, CEO of Invest India.\n* Tesla's recent office lease: 5,850-square-foot space in Pune.\n\n## 4. Tesla Faces Range Exaggeration Lawsuit\n\n**Summary:**Three Tesla owners have initiated a class action lawsuit against the company, alleging that Tesla \"exaggerates\" its vehicle range ratings. The lawsuit references evidence suggesting that Tesla might have inflated range estimates, including a fine from South Korean regulators for false advertising.\n\n**Analysis:**Legal challenges, especially those that question the integrity of product claims, can significantly impact a company's reputation and stock value. If the allegations are proven true, Tesla might face not only financial repercussions but also a potential loss of trust among its customer base. However, it's essential to note that such investigations and lawsuits are not uncommon in the auto industry.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Plaintiffs: James Porter (Model Y Performance owner), Bryan Perez (Model 3 Long Range owner), and Dro Esraeili Estepanian (Model 3 Long Range owner).\n* Main Allegation: False advertising of Tesla's electric vehicles' range.\n* Evidence: South Korean regulators fined Tesla for false advertising regarding vehicle ranges.\n\n## 5. Tesla's AI Advancements with Nvidia\n\n**Summary:**Tesla and Nvidia, both recognized as leading AI stocks, have showcased significant advancements in the realm of artificial intelligence. Nvidia's impressive first quarter has had a ripple effect on Tesla's stock, emphasizing the intertwined nature of AI developments between the two tech giants.\n\n**Analysis:**The collaboration and mutual growth of Tesla and Nvidia in the AI sector underscore the potential of AI in reshaping the automotive and tech industries. As AI continues to evolve, partnerships and shared milestones between such companies can influence investor sentiment and stock trajectories.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Nvidia's stock performance: Decline of 4.8% this week.\n* AI's role: Both companies are at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom, influencing each other's stock performance.",

Tesla China sells 64,285 wholesale in July, a 31.38% month-over-month decline\n\nTesla China sold a total of 64,285 vehicles in July 2023, marking a 31.38% decline from June 2023. Despite the month-over-month decline, the sales represent a 127.82% year-over-year increase from July 2022.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Tesla China sold 64,285 vehicles in July 2023.\n* This represents a 31.38% decline from June 2023.\n* Year-over-year sales increased by 127.82% from July 2022.\n\n**Analysis:** The month-over-month decline in sales could be a concern for investors and could potentially negatively impact Tesla's stock. However, the significant year-over-year growth in sales indicates that Tesla's overall market in China is growing, which could potentially boost Tesla's stock.\n\n## 2. Tesla CEO Elon Musk talks about the 'final piece' of solving Full Self-Driving\n\nElon Musk has stated that vehicle control is the \"final piece\" of solving Tesla's Full Self-Driving suite. Tesla is also in early discussions with a major OEM about adopting the FSD technology.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Elon Musk stated that vehicle control is the \"final piece\" of solving Tesla's Full Self-Driving suite.\n* Tesla is in early discussions with a major OEM about adopting the FSD technology.\n\n**Analysis:** If Tesla successfully solves the final piece of its Full Self-Driving suite, it could become a leader in autonomous vehicle technology. This could significantly increase the value of Tesla's vehicles and potentially boost its stock price.\n\n## 3.

If successful, this could lead to increased sales and a potential boost in Tesla's stock price.\n\n## 4. Tesla restarts Magic Dock installations by bringing them to new area\n\nTesla has resumed the installation of the Magic Dock, a connector that enables electric vehicle owners with the Combined Charging Standard (CCS) to recharge at Superchargers.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Texas is the third region where Tesla has introduced the Magic Dock, following New York and California.\n* The Magic Dock allows electric vehicles with the Combined Charging Standard (CCS) to recharge at Tesla's Superchargers.\n\n**Analysis:** The installation of the Magic Dock in more regions could make Tesla's Supercharger network more accessible to a wider range of electric vehicles, not just Tesla's. This could potentially increase the usage of Tesla's Supercharger network and generate additional revenue, which could positively impact Tesla's stock.\n\n## 5. Tesla\u2019s apparent red carpet treatment in India an effective tool against rivals\n\nTesla appears to be receiving a warm welcome in India, which could potentially give it an edge over its rivals in the country. The company is reportedly in discussions with Indian officials for the buildout of a plant that would produce a new low-cost electric car priced at around $24,000.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Tesla is reportedly in discussions with Indian officials for the buildout of a plant to produce a new low-cost electric car.\n* Chinese automaker BYD, one of Tesla's largest rivals in China, seems to be taking a backseat in India.\n\n**Analysis:** The apparent lack of competition from Chinese automakers like BYD could give Tesla a significant advantage in the Indian market. This could potentially lead to increased market share and higher sales, which could positively impact Tesla's stock.",

      "selftext": "## 1. Tesla seeks $100M in funding for Semi charging route from TX to CA: Bloomberg\n\nTesla is reportedly seeking approximately $100 million in funding to establish a charging route from Texas to California. This route would include nine charging stations designed for all electric-semi trucks. Tesla has approached the Texas Department of Transportation for this funding, stating that it could qualify for grants from the bipartisan infrastructure program initiated by the Biden administration.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Tesla is seeking $100 million in funding.\n* The proposed charging route would host nine charging stations.\n* The charging corridor would stretch from Fremont, California to Laredo, Texas.\n* Tesla plans to contribute $24 million to the project.\n\n**Analysis:** The establishment of this charging route could significantly boost Tesla's infrastructure for electric-semi trucks, potentially attracting more customers and increasing sales. However, if Tesla does not secure the funding, it may have to delay or cancel the project, which could negatively impact investor sentiment.\n\n## 2. Tesla subjected to another NHTSA probe, this time for steering\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has initiated another probe into Tesla, this time focusing on potential loss of steering control in Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. The investigation was initiated following twelve complaints alleging loss of steering control and power steering in these vehicles.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* The NHTSA is investigating potential loss of steering control in Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.\n* The investigation was initiated following twelve complaints.\n* There has been one report of a crash or fire as a result of the issue.\n\n**Analysis:** The investigation by the NHTSA could lead to negative publicity for Tesla, potentially impacting investor sentiment and causing a drop in Tesla's stock price. If the NHTSA finds that the issue poses an unreasonable safety risk, it could lead to a recall of affected vehicles, resulting in significant costs for Tesla.\n\n## 3. A Tesla Competitor Is Closing In. How BYD Could Catch the EV Leader.\n\nBYD, China's largest seller of battery-electric vehicles, is gradually closing the gap with Tesla, the global leader in the electric vehicle market. In July, BYD announced new energy deliveries of 261,105 units, including about 134,800 all battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), up from about 81,000 BEVs sold in July 2022.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* BYD delivered about 134,800 all battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) in July.\n* Over the past three months, BYD has delivered about 383,000 BEVs.\n* Tesla delivered about 466,000 BEVs in the second quarter.\n\n**Analysis:** The rise of BYD as a strong competitor in the EV market could pose a threat to Tesla's dominance, potentially impacting Tesla's market share and stock price. However, Tesla still leads significantly in terms of market capitalization, indicating strong investor confidence in Tesla.\n\n## 4. Is Ford Falling Behind Tesla in the EV Race?\n\nDespite posting encouraging second-quarter results, Ford saw its stock fall around 4% due to concerns about its electric vehicle (EV) initiatives. Ford's Model e segment, which focuses on electric vehicles and connectivity, saw a 39% year-over-year increase in revenue to $1.8 billion. However, the segment is expected to incur a significant EBIT loss of $4.5 billion in 2023.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Ford's Model e segment saw a 39% year-over-year increase in revenue to $1.8 billion.\n* Ford's EV production is not expected to reach an annualized run rate of 600,000 units until 2024.\n\n**Analysis:** Ford's slower-than-expected adoption of EVs and delayed production targets could mean less competitive pressure for Tesla, potentially benefiting Tesla's stock. However, Tesla's significant market share in the U.S., compared to Ford's falling position, could indicate a stronger market position and potential for continued growth for Tesla.",

This suggests that Tesla China sold about 31,300 vehicles domestically from July 1 to July 30.\n\n### Analysis\nThe reported increase in domestic sales in China, a key market for Tesla, could boost investor confidence and potentially lead to a positive impact on the stock price. Despite the focus on exports in the first half of a quarter, Tesla China's domestic sales remain strong. This suggests that Tesla's strategy of balancing domestic sales and exports is working, which could positively impact the stock price.\n\n### Key Data\n- Week ending July 30 registrations: 10,600\n- Previous week registrations: 7,700\n- Total July registrations: 31,300\n\n## 2.

This could ensure the continuity of Tesla's production and potentially lead to a positive impact on the stock price. Depending on the terms of the deal, Tesla could potentially secure lithium at a cost-effective rate, which could improve the company's profit margins and positively impact the stock price.\n\n## 4. Tesla completes acquisition of wireless charging company Wiferion\nTesla has finalized the acquisition of Wiferion, a wireless charging company. This move comes a few months after Tesla hinted at the development of a wireless EV charging platform for its vehicles. The acquisition was first reported by German media outlets and has now been confirmed. Wiferion had previously entered the North American market through a global licensing agreement with WiTricity, a company that showcased wireless charging technology using a Tesla Model 3 in its promotional campaigns. Tesla had also teased the use of wireless charging during its Investor Day earlier this year. \n\n### Analysis\nThe acquisition of Wiferion signals Tesla's commitment to innovation and technological advancement. This could boost investor confidence in Tesla's long-term strategy and potentially lead to a positive impact on the stock price. Wireless charging could provide Tesla with a significant competitive advantage in the EV market. If successfully implemented, this could increase the attractiveness of Tesla's vehicles to consumers, potentially leading to increased sales and a positive impact on the stock price.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Tesla Model 3 and Model Y prices reportedly set to be cut, but not in U.S.\nTesla is reportedly planning to reduce the prices of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Hong Kong, with discounts ranging between 6% and 11.9% across various configurations of these all-electric vehicles. The Model 3's price varies from HK$341,200 ($43,745) for the Rear-Wheel-Drive configuration to HK$406,900 ($52,168) for the Performance variant. The Model Y, on the other hand, starts at HK$367,100 ($47,065) for the RWD and goes up to HK$428,700 ($54,963) for the Performance variant. These price cuts were first reported by the Hong Kong Economic Times, but Tesla has not yet confirmed them.\n\n### Analysis\nThe price reduction could lead to increased sales of Tesla vehicles in Hong Kong, which could positively impact Tesla's revenue and, by extension, its stock price. The price cut could be seen as a strategic move by Tesla to remain competitive in the Hong Kong market, especially against other electric vehicle manufacturers.

      "selftext": "## 1. Elon Musk says Tesla Full Self-Driving v12 Alpha build is 'mind-blowing'\n\nElon Musk has recently tested an unreleased version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) suite, known as the v12 Alpha build, and described its performance as \"mind-blowing\". This version comes after the recent rollout of the v11.4.6 FSD Beta to non-employees. Musk has been promoting the performance of the upcoming 12th version of the FSD suite for about a month now. Although it's not ready for public release, Musk hinted it could be available to customers later this year, following further refinements. Notably, the v12 is expected to be the first FSD version to shed the \"beta\" label, indicating a significant confidence boost by Tesla in its self-driving technology. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the suite will be capable of fully-autonomous driving, but rather it represents an improvement over past iterations. The v12 build is expected to be the most accurate and robust to date, thanks in part to the vast amount of driving data collected and the rollout of the Dojo supercomputer.\n\n### Key Data\n\n- The v12 Alpha build of the Full Self-Driving suite is currently under testing.\n- This version is expected to shed the \"beta\" label, indicating a major milestone in Tesla's self-driving technology.\n- The release date is not confirmed, but Musk hinted it could be available to customers later this year.\n\n## 2. Tesla Cybertruck will be loved by younger buyers: Wall Street veteran\n\nThe Tesla Cybertruck, one of the most anticipated products from Tesla, is expected to start customer deliveries soon, marking a new chapter in Tesla's history. The vehicle's design is intentionally polarizing and futuristic, and it has already garnered an estimated 1.9 million pre-orders. Wall Street veteran and Managing Partner of The Future Fund, Gary Black, recently stated on CNBC\u2019s Last Call that the Cybertruck could produce another halo effect for Tesla, similar to what the Model Y did. He also predicted that the Cybertruck will find a loyal consumer base, especially among younger pickup truck owners. Black believes that the Cybertruck will not cannibalize any of Tesla's existing products as Tesla has never been in the pickup truck business before.\n\n### Key Data\n\n- The Tesla Cybertruck has an estimated 1.9 million pre-orders.\n- The base model is expected to be priced just below $50,000.\n- Deliveries are expected to start by the end of the third quarter.\n\n## 3. Tesla EVs are apparently overestimating range when fully charged \u2014 on purpose\n\nAccording to a report by Reuters, Tesla has been intentionally inflating the range estimates of its electric vehicles under the guidance of CEO Elon Musk. The company reportedly started using algorithms about a decade ago that would inflate projections at a full charge. However, once Teslas reach a 50 percent state of charge, the numbers become more realistic, with a 15-mile buffer that allows the vehicle to drive on battery after it reaches zero. The report also alleges that Tesla created a dedicated \"Diversion Team\" last summer focused solely on canceling service appointments from customers concerned about their vehicles falling short of the range estimate shown after a full charge. Tesla has faced regulatory scrutiny worldwide over its inflated range estimates, including a fine of $2.2 million in South Korea for delivering as little as half of its cars' estimated range in cold weather.\n\n### Key Data\n\n- Tesla has been reportedly inflating the range estimates of its electric vehicles at a full charge.\n- Once Teslas reach a 50 percent state of charge, the range estimates become more realistic.\n- Tesla has faced regulatory scrutiny and fines over its inflated range estimates.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Tesla Bulls Ignore Bad News. What Three Bears Have to Say.\n\nDespite Tesla's stock tumbling after its earnings were released on July 20, the stock has seen an overall increase of about 111% year to date. However, some skeptics believe that the stock is overpriced. Francisco Bido, senior portfolio manager for the Integrated Alpha group of F/m Investments, and Christopher Rossbach, CIO at of J. Stern& Co., argue that Tesla's stock, trading at 56 times estimated 2024 earnings, is too high for a car company. \n\nStephen Beck of consultancy cg42, who has worked with automakers developing strategy, believes Tesla has a product lineup problem. He points out that the Model 3 is old and needs a refresh, and the Cybertruck is entering a very competitive truck market. \n\nTesla is expected to begin delivering the Cybertruck later in 2023, and a smaller, lower-priced vehicle might arrive as soon as 2025 when Tesla\u2019s recently announced Mexican facility starts to produce cars.\n\n### Key Data\n\n- Tesla's stock is up about 111% year to date.\n- Tesla's stock trades for 56 times estimated 2024 earnings.\n- Tesla sold 112,791 Model 3 vehicles in the first half of the year, up 11% from the same period in 2022.",

      "selftext": "## 1. Tesla under investigation by California attorney general over Autopilot safety, marketing\n\nThe California attorney general's office is investigating Tesla over safety issues and false advertising complaints related to its Autopilot system. The investigation was revealed after the attorney general's office contacted customers and former employees for information.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Complaints about Tesla's Autopilot system: \"Phantom braking\" and misleading marketing of Full Self Driving (FSD) option\n* Tesla's profitability in the first half of 2023: 10.5%\n\n**Analysis:** The investigation could potentially lead to legal action against Tesla, resulting in fines or other penalties, which could negatively impact Tesla's financial position and its stock. The complaints about \"phantom braking\" and misleading marketing of the FSD option could damage Tesla's reputation, potentially impacting customer trust and sales, which could negatively affect Tesla's stock.\n\n## 2. Tesla now entering the real world of manufacturing and competition: Stellantis CEO\n\nCarlos Tavares, the CEO of Stellantis, has stated that Tesla is now entering the real world of manufacturing and competition. He also noted a decline in Tesla's profitability.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Tesla's profitability: Decreased from over 17% in the first half of 2022 to 10.5% in the first half of 2023\n* Stellantis' margin on adjusted EBIT: 14.4%\n\n**Analysis:** The entry of Tesla into the \"real world\" of manufacturing and competition, as described by Stellantis' CEO, could potentially increase the challenges faced by the company. This could put pressure on Tesla's profitability and, in turn, its stock. Elon Musk's preference for growth over profitability could potentially lead to short-term decreases in profitability, as seen in the first half of 2023. However, if this strategy leads to long-term growth and market dominance, it could potentially have a positive impact on Tesla's stock in the long run.\n\n## 3. GM, Hyundai and other car manufacturers to build 30,000 fast EV chargers in challenge to Tesla\n\nSeven major automobile manufacturers, including General Motors, Stellantis, Hyundai, Kia, Honda, BMW, and Mercedes Benz, have announced a joint venture to expand a network of fast-charging electric-vehicle hookups in North America. This move is intended to compete with Tesla's Superchargers and to leverage subsidies from the Biden administration.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Joint venture target: 30,000 fast chargers\n* Companies involved in the joint venture: General Motors, Stellantis, Hyundai, Kia, Honda, BMW, and Mercedes Benz\n* Tesla's current network: Almost 18,000 Superchargers\n\n**Analysis:** The joint venture by major automobile manufacturers could increase competition in the EV charging infrastructure market, potentially challenging Tesla's dominance. This could impact Tesla's competitive advantage and its stock. The joint venture's plan to leverage federal subsidies could provide significant capital for the expansion of the charging network. However, changes in government policy or reductions in subsidies could impact the joint venture's ability to expand and maintain its network, which could indirectly benefit Tesla.\n\n## 4. Cathie Wood Speaks Her Mind on Tesla, Meta, Nvidia, AI, and More\n\nCathie Wood, founder and CEO of ARK Investment Management, has shared her views on several companies and technologies, including Tesla. Despite selling some shares as Tesla's stock price increased, she maintains a $2,000 price target on Tesla's stock. She expects Tesla to maintain its market share as the global sales of electric vehicles increase from seven million last year to 60 million by 2027.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) gain through July 26: 54.5%\n* Tesla's stock price target according to Cathie Wood: $2,000\n* Predicted EBITDA for Tesla's robotaxi business by 2027: $227 billion\n\n**Analysis:** Cathie Wood's bullish outlook on Tesla, including her high price target and expectations for the robotaxi business, could potentially boost investor confidence and positively impact Tesla's stock. Wood's strategy of selling Tesla shares when the stock price increases to invest in other stocks could potentially lead to short-term decreases in Tesla's stock price. However, her continued confidence in the company could support the stock price in the long term.\n\n## 5. Tesla confirms V4 Supercharger with 350 kW power capacity\n\nTesla has confirmed the development of a V4 Supercharger with a power capacity of 350 kW. This new Supercharger will be significantly more powerful than the current V3 Superchargers, which have a power capacity of 250 kW.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Power capacity of new V4 Supercharger: 350 kW\n* Power capacity of current V3 Supercharger: 250 kW\n\n**Analysis:** The development of a more powerful Supercharger could enhance Tesla's charging infrastructure, potentially attracting more customers and increasing sales, which could positively impact Tesla's stock. However, the development and deployment of the new Superchargers could involve significant costs, which could impact Tesla's profitability and its stock.\n\n## 6. Major OEMs teaming up to dethrone Tesla's charging dominance\n\nSeveral major Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are teaming up to challenge Tesla's dominance in the EV charging market. The OEMs, including Ford, BMW, and Volkswagen, are planning to build a charging network that could rival Tesla's Supercharger network.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Companies involved in the joint venture: Ford, BMW, Volkswagen, and others\n* Tesla's current network: Almost 18,000 Superchargers\n\n**Analysis:** The joint venture by major OEMs could increase competition in the EV charging infrastructure market, potentially challenging Tesla's dominance. This could impact Tesla's competitive advantage and its stock. However, the increased availability of charging infrastructure could support the growth of the EV market, which could benefit Tesla as the current market leader.\n\n## 7. Tesla's Cybertruck production delayed to 2023\n\nTesla has announced that the production of its Cybertruck has been delayed to 2023. The company cited supply chain issues and the need for further product refinement as reasons for the delay.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* New production start date for Cybertruck: 2023\n* Original production start date for Cybertruck: 2021\n\n**Analysis:** The delay in Cybertruck production could potentially impact Tesla's sales and profitability, which could negatively impact its stock. The delay could also damage Tesla's reputation and customer trust, potentially impacting future sales. However, if the delay results in a better product, it could potentially enhance customer satisfaction and sales in the long run, which could positively impact Tesla's stock.",

Tesla sales in California outpace the world's best-selling car company\n\nTesla has outsold Toyota in California in the second quarter of 2023 by nearly 2,000 units, surpassing the automaker in terms of total registrations. This dominance was primarily driven by the Model 3 and Model Y. Tesla registered 69,212 cars throughout the second quarter of the year, while Toyota managed to obtain 67,482 registrations in the same timeframe.\n\n## Key Data:\n\n* Tesla outsold Toyota in California in Q2 2023 by nearly 2,000 units.\n* Tesla registered 69,212 cars in Q2 2023, while Toyota registered 67,482 cars.\n* Tesla's sales in Q2 2023 increased by 62.3% compared to Q2 2022.\n\n## Analysis:\n\nThis is a significant milestone for Tesla, as it has been the company's goal since its inception to make EVs affordable and take market share from gasoline competitors. Tesla's sales in Q2 2023 increased by 62.3% compared to the same quarter last year, allowing it to catch up with Toyota, which had dominated the market share during the same period in 2022.\n\n## 2. Tesla's first EV plant stoppage begins at Fremont Factory\n\nTesla has begun its first electric vehicle plant stoppage at the Fremont Factory. This comes a week after CEO Elon Musk announced that production facilities would be closed intermittently throughout the third quarter for plant upgrades. Musk stated during the Q2 Earnings Call that Q3 production would be slightly down as the company upgraded its production facilities, possibly to make way for new vehicles.\n\n## Key Data:\n\n* Tesla has started its first EV plant stoppage at the Fremont Factory for upgrades.\n* The company is likely preparing production lines for new vehicle builds of the Model 3 and making more room at the factory.\n* Tesla's Q3 production is expected to be slightly down due to these upgrades.\n\n## Analysis:\n\nThe temporary halt in production could lead to a slight decrease in Tesla's Q3 production. However, the upgrades being made at the Fremont Factory are likely to increase Tesla's production capacity in the long run. This could lead to increased sales and revenue, which could have a positive impact on Tesla's stock price in the long term.\n\n## 3. Tesla China insurance registrations slip 23% to 7,700 units in July\u2019s third week\n\nTesla China's export efforts for the third quarter appear to be ramping up, as suggested by drone flyovers of the Shanghai Port and the trend in the country's domestic vehicle insurance registrations. Tesla China does not post its weekly sales figures, but the general trend of the company's vehicle sales per week can be inferred through insurance registrations across the country.\n\n## Key Data:\n\n* Tesla China sold 7,700 vehicles domestically in the week ending July 23, a 23% decrease from the previous week.\n* Tesla's local sales in China are currently estimated at 20,700 vehicles.\n* The 7,700 vehicle registrations in the third week of July are more than double the 3,200 registrations reported in the week ending July 9.\n\n## Analysis:\n\nThe decrease in weekly sales could potentially concern investors and have a short-term negative impact on Tesla's stock price. However, the fact that the third week's registrations are still significantly higher than those of the first week of July could mitigate this impact. The ramping up of Tesla's export efforts from China could potentially lead to increased global sales, which could have a positive impact on Tesla's stock price.\n\n## 4. Tesla the most preferred EV among dispatchers and drivers: study\n\nA study conducted by software company Circuit has revealed that Tesla is the most preferred brand among delivery drivers and dispatchers when it comes to electric vehicles. The study surveyed over 1,000 delivery drivers and dispatchers to find out how they are working to reduce their carbon footprints.\n\n## Key Data:\n\n* One-fifth of dispatchers plan to switch to hybrid or electric vehicles to reduce operating costs.\n* Almost one in ten delivery drivers drive an electric vehicle.\n* Among the EVs available, 51% of drivers and 38% of dispatchers prefer Tesla.\n\n## Analysis:\n\nThe fact that Tesla is the most preferred brand among delivery drivers and dispatchers could increase the demand for Tesla vehicles, which could have a positive impact on Tesla's stock price. The study's findings that a significant number of dispatchers plan to switch to hybrid or electric vehicles indicate a growing trend towards electric vehicles. This could benefit Tesla as a leading EV manufacturer and potentially lead to a rise in its stock price.\n\n## 5. Tesla one of several EV makers set to be wooed by Indonesia for investment\n\nTesla, along with several other automakers, is being enticed by Indonesia with incentives to encourage investment in the country. This is part of Indonesia's ongoing efforts to attract leading automakers. The Indonesian government has been in talks with Tesla for years, with significant developments occurring over the past year.\n\n## Key Data:\n\n* Indonesia is offering its rich nickel reserves to support battery production.\n* Tesla is reportedly nearing an agreement with Indonesia to build a one-million-unit annual vehicle production plant.\n* Indonesia is planning to offer substantial incentives to attract EV companies, including Tesla and BYD.\n\n## Analysis:\n\nIf Tesla decides to invest in Indonesia, it could potentially open up a new market for the company. This could lead to increased sales and revenue, which could positively impact the stock price. The proposed one-million-unit annual vehicle production plant would significantly increase Tesla's production capacity. This could lead to a higher stock price if the increased production leads to increased sales.\n\n## 6. Tesla China\u2019s export efforts ramp up in Q3\n\nTesla China\u2019s export efforts for the third quarter appear to be ramping up. This was hinted at in drone flyovers of the Shanghai Port, as well as the trend in the country\u2019s domestic vehicle insurance registrations. Tesla China does not post its weekly sales figures, but the general trend of the company\u2019s vehicle sales per week can be inferred through insurance registrations across the country.\n\n## Key Data:\n\n* Tesla China sold 7,700 vehicles domestically in the week ending July 23, down 23% from the 10,000 vehicles that were sold in China in the week ending July 16.\n* Tesla's local sales in China are currently estimated at 20,700 vehicles.\n\n## Analysis:\n\nThe decrease in weekly sales could potentially concern investors and have a short-term negative impact on Tesla's stock price. However, the ramping up of Tesla's export efforts from China could potentially lead to increased global sales, which could have a positive impact on Tesla's stock price.",

      "selftext": "## 1. Tesla set to launch talks for $24,000 car factory in India\n\nTesla is reportedly planning to initiate discussions later this month to establish a factory in India that would manufacture a $24,000 car. Tesla and India have a long history of negotiations for a potential vehicle production plant, but past talks have often been derailed by minor details. However, 2023 seems to be different, with Tesla and India having advanced discussions throughout the year. The previous issues with import duties appear to have been resolved in a way that satisfies both parties. According to Reuters, Tesla plans to meet with India's commerce minister in July to discuss the proposed factory, which would produce a $24,000 car for the local market and for export.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Tesla is planning to establish a factory in India to produce a $24,000 car.\n* Tesla and India have resolved previous issues with import duties.\n* The proposed factory would produce cars for the local market and for export.\n\n**Analysis:** The establishment of a factory in India represents a significant expansion of Tesla's market. India is one of the largest and fastest-growing auto markets in the world, and a successful entry could significantly boost Tesla's sales and profits. Manufacturing cars in India could allow Tesla to avoid high import duties, reducing the cost of its cars in the Indian market. This could make Tesla's cars more competitive and increase sales.\n\n## 2. Tesla fans believe Ford is the 'major OEM' discussing Full Self-Driving licensing\n\nTesla enthusiasts are largely convinced that Ford is the \"major OEM\" that Tesla is in talks with to license the Full Self-Driving (FSD) suite. This speculation arose after Tesla's Q2 2023 Earnings Call, where CEO Elon Musk mentioned that they were in \"early discussions with a major OEM\" about using Tesla's FSD. Musk had previously stated that Tesla was open to licensing either Autopilot or Full Self-Driving, as well as other Tesla technology. Ford was the first to adopt Tesla\u2019s North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector, followed by General Motors, which further fuels the speculation. Other companies like Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, and Rivian were also mentioned as potential partners.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Tesla is in early discussions with a major OEM about licensing its Full Self-Driving suite.\n* Ford was the first to adopt Tesla\u2019s North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector.\n* Other potential partners include Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, and Rivian.\n\n**Analysis:** If Tesla successfully licenses its FSD technology to a major OEM like Ford, it could open up a new revenue stream for the company. This could positively impact Tesla's financial performance. The licensing of Tesla's technology to other major automakers could be seen as a validation of Tesla's technological prowess in the self-driving space. This could increase market confidence in Tesla's capabilities and future prospects.\n\n## 3. Fed\u2019s deadline comes and goes without Tesla\u2019s reply to Autopilot questions\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) had set a deadline for Tesla to provide updated responses to some questions regarding the performance of its Autopilot driver assistance system. This came in the wake of over a dozen crashes where Tesla vehicles struck stationary emergency vehicles. The NHTSA is also investigating whether Tesla vehicles adequately ensure drivers are paying attention when using the Autopilot system. Despite the deadline of July 19, 2023, Tesla has not yet responded. The NHTSA's investigation was prompted by 736 crashes and 17 fatalities involving Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system since 2019. The agency is also looking into 16 collisions that Teslas have had with emergency vehicles.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* NHTSA set a deadline for Tesla to provide updated responses to questions about its Autopilot system.\n* Tesla has not responded by the deadline.\n* The NHTSA's investigation was prompted by 736 crashes and 17 fatalities involving Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system since 2019.\n\n**Analysis:** The ongoing investigation by the NHTSA and Tesla's failure to respond by the deadline could increase regulatory scrutiny of the company. This could potentially lead to fines or other penalties, which could negatively impact Tesla's financial performance. The investigation and Tesla's failure to respond in a timely manner could damage the company's reputation, particularly regarding the safety of its Autopilot system. This could potentially reduce consumer trust in Tesla's products, leading to lower sales.",

      "selftext": "## 1. Tesla launches EV sales in Malaysia\n\nTesla has confirmed the launch of its electric vehicle sales in Malaysia. The company has been working to expand its sales footprint to new markets for several years, with Asia being a particularly strong market due to the operation of Giga Shanghai in China. Tesla began preparing for Malaysian auto sales in February after receiving approval from the country's government to import Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). The company is now set to establish several new branches of operation, including a Head Office, Service Centers, and a Supercharger Network. Tesla has already received 10,000 Model Y orders just 96 hours after its launch in Malaysia.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Tesla has launched its electric vehicle sales in Malaysia.\n* Tesla received approval from the Malaysian government to import BEVs in February.\n* Tesla has received 10,000 Model Y orders within 96 hours of its launch in Malaysia.\n\n## 2. Tesla Cybertruck orders reach 1.9 million\n\nTesla Cybertruck orders have surpassed 1.9 million, indicating a high demand for the vehicle. Despite the potential wait time of four or five years, people are still placing deposits. The unique design of the all-electric pickup and the claims Tesla has made about it have undoubtedly piqued interest. As of now, the Cybertruck has reached 1,943,876 reservations, equating to over $194 million in pre-order revenue. This number is nearly double the reservation count from just over two years ago.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Tesla Cybertruck orders have surpassed 1.9 million.\n* The number of reservations equates to over $194 million in pre-order revenue.\n* The number of orders is nearly double the reservation count from just over two years ago.\n\n## 3. Volvo Cars will use Tesla's Superchargers but not its autonomous driving tech\n\nVolvo Cars has decided not to use Tesla's autonomous driving technology, instead focusing on developing its own systems, according to CEO Jim Rowan. While Volvo has an agreement with Tesla that allows its electric vehicles access to Tesla's Superchargers, the company has chosen to maintain full control of its advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD) software. Volvo Cars has also taken full ownership of Zenseact, a business specializing in AD software. The company's second-quarter results showed earnings before interest and taxes of 5 billion Swedish krona (around $487.5 million), compared to 10.8 billion Swedish krona in the second quarter of 2022. Sales of fully electric Volvo car models increased by 178% year-on-year during the quarter, accounting for 16% of its total share.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Volvo Cars will not use Tesla's autonomous driving technology.\n* Volvo Cars has an agreement with Tesla for access to Superchargers.\n* Volvo Cars' sales of fully electric models increased by 178% year-on-year during the quarter.\n\n## 4. What Elon Musk\u2019s AI Startup Means for Tesla\u2019s AI Ambitions\n\nElon Musk's latest startup, xAI, is taking advantage of the rush of enthusiasm\u2014and presumably money\u2014to develop a humanlike artificial-intelligence technology. However, this has raised questions about whether Tesla investors are helped or hindered by this new venture. Many investors have long been excited about Tesla\u2019s work and plans for deploying AI with driverless cars and humanoid robots. Tesla is seen as a tech powerhouse that can truly deploy AI into the real world\u2014doing hard, meaningful tasks.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Elon Musk's new startup, xAI, is developing a humanlike artificial-intelligence technology.\n* Tesla is working on AI for specific tasks like driving and developing a humanoid robot.\n* Tesla plans to spend more than $1 billion through the end of next year on a supercomputer dubbed Dojo.\n\n## 5. Tesla Stock Hit With Another Downgrade. But It\u2019s Getting a Lot Right.\n\nTesla's stock was downgraded to Neutral from Buy by analysts at UBS due to the recent increase in the company's share price. UBS analyst Patrick Hummel downgraded Tesla stock to Hold from Buy on Monday, while raising his price target to $270 from $220. The shares were down 1% to just above $260 each in premarket trading.\n\nTesla's stock price has been pushed higher due to the company getting it right on its pricing, production, and technology. Deals with auto makers opening up the Tesla supercharging network to non-Tesla electric vehicles, as well as enthusiasm about artificial intelligence, helped shares gain 28% in June.\n\nHummel's downgrade is the fifth since mid-June as analysts want to take some profit. Tesla stock is up about 111% so far this year. However, shares are only up roughly 10% since Hummel upgraded Tesla stock to Buy in June 2022.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Tesla's stock was downgraded to Neutral from Buy by analysts at UBS.\n* UBS analyst Patrick Hummel raised his price target for Tesla to $270 from $220.\n* Tesla's stock price has increased by 111% so far this year.",

      "selftext": "## 1. Tesla's Full Self-Driving feature could add $20 billion a year in revenue, Gene Munster says\n\nGene Munster, the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, has suggested that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software could significantly boost the company's revenue. If Tesla licenses out the technology and lowers the price, it could add up to $20 billion a year. However, Tesla's stock slid 8% on Thursday as investors reacted to the company's lower profit margins for the second quarter.\n\n**Key Data**\n\n* Tesla's FSD software could add up to $20 billion a year in revenue.\n* Tesla's stock slid 8% on Thursday due to lower profit margins for Q2.\n* Tesla could be pulling in $100 billion in operating income in 10 years, with FSD licensing contributing an additional 20% to operating profits.\n\n**Analysis** The potential for FSD licensing to contribute significantly to operating profits in the long term could make Tesla's stock more attractive to long-term investors. However, the recent slide in Tesla's stock price shows that investors are concerned about the company's profit margins. If Tesla can improve its margins, as Munster predicts, this could have a positive impact on the stock.\n\n## 2. Musk mulling more price cuts for Tesla models\n\nElon Musk is contemplating reducing the prices of Tesla vehicles, focusing on sales over profits with the expectation that the self-driving software will eventually enhance margins. However, this focus could impact current profit margins as the company faces multiple probes from U.S. safety regulators involving various crashes involving Tesla models.\n\n**Key Data**\n\n* The company's automotive gross margin slipped to 18.1% from 19% in the first quarter, marking a sharp decline from the 26% reported a year ago.\n* Tesla shares are up 137% year to date.\n\n**Analysis** Lowering the prices of Tesla vehicles could lead to increased sales, which would provide more data to improve Tesla's self-driving technology. However, this strategy could also lead to lower profit margins in the short term, which could negatively impact the stock price. The ongoing probes from U.S. safety regulators could pose a risk to Tesla's reputation and its stock price.\n\n## 3. Tesla seatbelt recall affects nearly 16,000 Model S and Model X\n\nTesla is recalling approximately 16,000 units of the Model S and Model X due to a seat belt issue. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has reported that the front-row seat belts in certain 2021-2023 Model S and Model X vehicles may not be properly connected to the pretensioner anchors, which could cause them to detach.\n\n**Key Data**\n\n* Tesla is recalling nearly 16,000 units of the Model S and Model X due to a seat belt issue.\n* Tesla has identified 12 warranty claims related to this issue as of June 19.\n* A smaller recall has been opened for the 2023 Model S, Model X, and Model Y vehicles related to a potential misalignment of the forward-facing camera.\n\n**Analysis** Recalls can have a negative impact on a company's reputation and stock price, especially if they are related to safety issues. However, the fact that Tesla is proactively addressing these issues could mitigate some of this impact. The cost of the recall could impact Tesla's financials in the short term, which could put downward pressure on the stock.\n\n## 4. Tesla's Musk fine with taking this risk if it means higher production\n\nDuring Tesla's Q2 2023 Earnings Call, CEO Elon Musk stated that it \"makes sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making more vehicles,\" indicating a potential for further price cuts even amidst uncertain economic times. Tesla has been adjusting its vehicle prices to stimulate demand and increase orders.\n\n**Analysis** Lowering the prices of Tesla vehicles could lead to increased sales, which would provide more data to improve Tesla's self-driving technology. However, this strategy could also lead to lower profit margins in the short term, which could negatively impact the stock price. The willingness to sacrifice profit margins to increase production could be a concern for investors.\n\n## 5. Tesla stock is 1,000% overvalued, and its current market price is 'completely disconnected from reality', analyst says\n\nDavid Trainer, CEO of investment research firm New Constructs, has suggested that Tesla's stock is overvalued by more than 1,000%. In his view, the company's true value lies closer to $26 per share rather than the current price of around $290 per share.\n\n**Key Data**\n\n* David Trainer suggests that Tesla's true value lies closer to $26 per share.\n* Tesla's gross profit margin shrank to 18.1% in the April-June period.\n* Tesla's shares fell almost 10% following its latest financial results.\n\n**Analysis** The claim that Tesla's stock is overvalued by more than 1,000% could create uncertainty in the market, which could negatively impact the stock price. However, this is just one analyst's opinion, and other analysts may have different views on Tesla's valuation. The decrease in Tesla's gross profit margin could be a concern for investors. If the company cannot improve its margins, this could put downward pressure on the stock.\n\n## 6. Tesla Optimus Bot progress updated by Elon Musk\n\nTesla has updated the production figures for its Optimus Bot, the company's first humanoid robot. During Tesla\u2019s Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Elon Musk revealed that around 5 or 6 bots have been built so far, with more being produced every month. The relatively small number of Optimus Bots built is mainly due to issues with actuator supply, as Tesla found that no existing company could produce the correct device for the robot.\n\n**Key Data**\n\n* Tesla has built around 5 or 6 Optimus Bots so far.\n* The first production candidate actuators are expected to be integrated and walking around November.\n\n**Analysis** The development of the Optimus Bot showcases Tesla's innovative capabilities, which could be a positive driver for the stock. However, the success of this project is not guaranteed, and any setbacks could negatively impact the stock. The issues with actuator supply highlight the challenges Tesla faces in developing new products. If these supply chain issues persist or worsen, this could delay the production ramp of Optimus and negatively impact the stock.\n\n## 7. Tesla says factory upgrades are coming as new Model 3 'Highland' sightings continue\n\nDuring its Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Tesla announced that factory upgrades would take place in Q3, potentially causing a slight decrease in production as the company prepares to launch a new and revised version of the Model 3, known as \u201cProject Highland.\u201d CEO Elon Musk stated that investors should expect lower-than-normal production figures for Q3 due to summer shutdowns of some of the automaker\u2019s factories.\n\n**Key Data**\n\n* Tesla is planning factory upgrades in Q3, which could lead to a slight decrease in production.\n\n**Analysis** The planned decrease in production for Q3 due to factory upgrades could negatively impact Tesla's financials in the short term, which could put downward pressure on the stock. The factory upgrades could be seen as a positive sign for Tesla's long-term growth prospects, as they could lead to increased production efficiency and capacity in the future. The launch of the new and revised Model 3 could stimulate demand and increase sales, which could have a positive impact on the stock. However, the success of this new model is not guaranteed, and any setbacks could negatively impact the stock.",

      "selftext": "## 1. Tesla (TSLA) Q2 2023 Earnings Results: Expectations Beat Amid Record Quarter\n\nTesla posted its Q2 2023 earnings report, beating expectations. The company reported revenues of $24.93 billion, surpassing analysts' estimates of $24.32 billion. This represents a 47% year-over-year growth in revenue. Tesla's non-GAAP earnings per share for Q2 2023 was $0.91, exceeding analysts' expectations of $0.79 per share. However, Tesla's operating income decreased slightly year-over-year to $2.4 billion in the second quarter, resulting in a 9.6% operating margin. Tesla's cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased sequentially by $700 million to $23.1 billion in Q2 2023, driven by free cash flow of $1 billion.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n- Q2 2023 Revenue: $24.93 billion\n- Q2 2023 Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share: $0.91\n- Q2 2023 Operating Income: $2.4 billion\n- Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments at the end of Q2 2023: $23.1 billion\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Q2 2023 earnings report is likely to have the most significant impact on Tesla's stock. The company's strong revenue growth and better-than-expected earnings could boost investor confidence and positively impact the stock price. However, the decrease in operating income could be a concern for investors as it indicates lower profitability. The strong cash position provides the company with financial flexibility to invest in growth initiatives, manage debt, and weather potential economic downturns.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Tesla in Early Discussions to License Full Self-Driving to 'Major' Automaker\n\nTesla is in preliminary talks to license its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software to a major automaker. While the specific automaker has not been disclosed, it's noted that Ford and General Motors, who are developing their own self-driving efforts, were the first companies to adopt Tesla\u2019s NACS connector for their EVs.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n- Tesla is in early discussions to license its Full Self-Driving software to a major automaker.\n- Ford and General Motors were the first companies to adopt Tesla\u2019s NACS connector for their EVs.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe licensing discussions could lead to further partnerships with other automakers, potentially expanding Tesla's influence in the EV market and positively impacting the stock price. If Tesla successfully licenses its FSD technology to other automakers, it could open up a new revenue stream for the company. However, it could also potentially strengthen Tesla's competitors in the long run, which could have a negative impact on the stock price.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Tesla Requests Approval for Giga Berlin Expansion\n\nTesla has formally requested approval from local German authorities for Giga Berlin expansion and updates. The company plans to double its production capacity to 1 million cars per year and achieve 100-gigawatt hours of battery production at the plant.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n- Tesla plans to double its production capacity to 1 million cars per year.\n- The company aims to achieve 100-gigawatt hours of battery production at the plant.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nIf the expansion is approved and completed as planned, Tesla's production capacity will significantly increase. This could lead to a higher supply of Tesla vehicles, potentially increasing sales and revenue, which could positively impact the stock price. The proposed modifications suggest that Tesla is focusing on improving its operational efficiency. If these changes lead to cost savings and improved production efficiency, this could also positively impact the stock price.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Tesla Cybertruck Designs Were in No Shortage as Musk Combatted 'Boring' Pickups\n\nThe Tesla Cybertruck had numerous designs before the final version was unveiled. The Cybertruck has now reached initial production at Giga Texas, and deliveries are expected to begin soon.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n- The Tesla Cybertruck had numerous designs before the final version was unveiled.\n- The Cybertruck has now reached initial production at Giga Texas.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe launch of the Cybertruck marks Tesla's entry into the pickup truck market, which could help the company reach a new customer base and increase its market share. This could also have a positive impact on the stock price. The start of Cybertruck production and the upcoming deliveries could be a positive signal to investors, indicating that Tesla is making progress in its product roadmap.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Tesla FSD Will Be Transferable for a Limited Time\n\nTesla has announced that it will allow owners to transfer Full Self-Driving (FSD) from one car to another starting in the third quarter of this year. This decision may translate into sales in the next quarter as many drivers have chosen not to upgrade their Tesla with newer models because of Full Self-Driving.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n- Tesla will allow owners to transfer Full Self-Driving (FSD) from one car to another starting in Q3 2023.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe decision to allow FSD transfers could lead to increased sales in the next quarter as it may encourage owners to upgrade their Tesla vehicles. This could positively impact the stock price. However, it could also potentially decrease the sales of FSD if owners choose to transfer their existing FSD purchase to a new vehicle instead of buying a new FSD package. The net impact on revenue and the stock price would depend on the balance between these two effects.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Tesla and Nissan Agree to NACS Compatibility in Most Recent Adoption\n\nTesla and Nissan have agreed that the Japanese automaker will adopt the North American Charging Standard (NACS), allowing Nissan's EV drivers to access Tesla's Supercharging Network starting next year. From Spring 2024 until 2025, Nissan's EV drivers will be able to access 12,000 of Tesla's Supercharging locations across the U.S and Canada with a supplied adapter.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n- Nissan will adopt the North American Charging Standard (NACS), allowing access to Tesla's Supercharging Network.\n- From Spring 2024 until 2025, Nissan's EV drivers will be able to access 12,000 of Tesla's Supercharging locations across the U.S and Canada with a supplied adapter.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe agreement with Nissan could lead to increased usage of Tesla's Supercharging network, potentially generating additional revenue for Tesla.

      "selftext": "## 1. Tesla investors want to know about these five things during the Q2 2023 Earnings Call\n\n## Summary\n\nInvestors are keen to learn about several key areas during Tesla's Q2 2023 Earnings Call. These include details about Full Self-Driving (FSD) licensing, Cybertruck pricing and configurations, Supercharger network expansion, and the development of the 4680 cell.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe earnings call could have a significant impact on Tesla's stock depending on the information revealed. If Tesla has been approached by other automakers to license FSD, it could open a new revenue stream for the company. Information about Cybertruck orders, pricing, and specifications could influence investor sentiment. Tesla's plans for managing congestion and upgrading services as it opens its Supercharger Network to other EVs could impact investor confidence in the company's strategic planning and operational capabilities. The progress of the 4680 cell development could affect investor sentiment, as it is a key component of Tesla's future plans for battery technology and vehicle performance.\n\n## 2. Tesla shows Cybertruck seats and testing process in new video\n\n## Summary\n\nTesla has released a new video showcasing the rigorous testing process of the Cybertruck seats ahead of the pickup's imminent release. The company uses a \"seat testing robot\" to perform \"50,000 ingress/egress cycles\" on the Cybertruck seats, simulating a \"lifetime of use.\"\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe rigorous testing process for the Cybertruck seats demonstrates Tesla's commitment to quality and durability, which could boost investor confidence in the product's reliability. Tesla's ability to manufacture its own seats could be seen as a strategic advantage, reducing reliance on external suppliers and allowing for greater control over quality and costs. The imminent release of the Cybertruck and the showcasing of its features could generate excitement and anticipation among consumers and investors alike.\n\n## 3. Tesla China sees 10,000 insurance registrations on July\u2019s 2nd week\n\n## Summary\n\nTesla China saw an estimated 10,000 domestic sales for the week ending July 16, a 212.50% increase from the 3,200 insurance registrations for the week ending July 9. This suggests that Tesla China sold around 13,000 vehicles domestically between July 1 and 16.\n\n## Key Data\n\n* Estimated 10,000 domestic sales for the week ending July 16\n* 212.50% increase in domestic sales week-over-week\n* Approximately 13,000 vehicles sold domestically between July 1 and 16\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe significant week-over-week increase in domestic sales suggests strong demand for Tesla's vehicles in China, which could positively impact Tesla's stock as it indicates robust business performance in a key market. The fact that the majority of the sales are likely Model Y crossovers suggests strong demand for this model. This could be a positive sign for investors as it shows that Tesla's product diversification strategy is working.\n\n## 4. Japan's Nissan to adopt Tesla EV-charging design from 2025 in U.S., Canada\n\n## Summary\n\nNissan has become the first Japanese automaker to adopt Tesla's electric-vehicle charging technology in the U.S. and Canada. Starting in 2025, Nissan will equip its EVs with the Tesla-developed North American Charging Standard (NACS) port.\n\n## Analysis\n\nNissan's decision to adopt Tesla's EV charging design could lead to more widespread acceptance of Tesla's charging standard. This could strengthen Tesla's position in the EV infrastructure market and potentially have a positive impact on the stock. The decision by Nissan to equip its EVs with adapters to use Tesla's Supercharger network could lead to increased usage of Tesla's charging infrastructure. This could generate additional revenue for Tesla and potentially have a positive impact on the stock.",

      "selftext": "## 1. Cybertruck Rally Triggers Cathie Wood Tesla Stock Dump Ahead Of Q2 Earnings\n\nCathie Wood and her Ark Invest firm sold off another tranche of their Tesla (TSLA) stock holdings Monday, unloading more than 45,000 shares, as the EV giant rallied on news surrounding the much anticipated Cybertruck.

This could have a positive impact on Tesla's stock.\n\n## 3. Tesla Semi Real-World Performance Hints at the Arrival of a New King of the Road\n\nThe Tesla Semi, although not yet in mass production, has been seen in action on the roads, demonstrating impressive performance. Videos shared by Tesla enthusiasts show the all-electric Class 8 truck easily passing diesel-powered trucks, even on uphill roads.\n\n## Key Data\n\n* Tesla Semi has been seen in action on the roads, demonstrating impressive performance.\n* Tesla CEO Elon Musk expects meaningful production numbers for the Semi around late 2024.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe impressive performance of the Tesla Semi as seen in the videos could boost investor confidence in Tesla's ability to disrupt the trucking industry, potentially leading to a rise in Tesla's stock price.\n\n## 4. Tesla Involved in New Lawsuit, This Time as the Plaintiff\n\nTesla is involved in a new lawsuit, this time as the plaintiff against an Australian supercapacitor company, Cap-XX. Tesla alleges that Cap-XX infringed on two U.S. patents owned by Maxwell Technologies, a company Tesla acquired in 2019.\n\n## Key Data\n\n* Tesla is suing Cap-XX for allegedly infringing on two of Maxwell Technologies\u2019 patents.\n* Tesla acquired Maxwell Technologies in 2019 to advance its battery technology.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe ongoing lawsuit could create legal risks for Tesla, which could potentially impact its stock.

Tesla Cybertruck Production Line Leaks Suggest No RHD Variant for Now\n\nTesla Cybertruck fans received several updates and leaks over the weekend, including an official photo from Tesla announcing that the production of the all-electric truck is already underway. From these photos, it was inferred that the Cybertruck\u2019s firewall is asymmetrical, meaning the cutout for the steering wheel column was only on the left side of the vehicle. This design suggests that the Cybertruck would only be offered in Left Hand Drive (LHD) variants, at least for now.\n\n## Key Data\n\n* The Cybertruck\u2019s firewall is asymmetrical, suggesting that the vehicle will only be offered in LHD variants for now.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe decision to initially offer only LHD variants of the Cybertruck could limit the market for the vehicle, potentially impacting Tesla's sales and, by extension, its stock price. However, this impact could be temporary if Tesla decides to offer RHD variants in the future.\n\n## 7. Elon Musk Potentially Drops Subtle Hint at Tesla Cybertruck Pricing\n\nElon Musk may have hinted at the pricing of the Tesla Cybertruck by stating that its likely competitor, the Ford F-150 Lightning, is \u201csomewhat expensive,\u201d even after Ford dropped prices by as much as $10,000.\n\n## Key Data\n\n* Musk's comments suggest that the Cybertruck could undercut the F-150 Lightning in even its cheapest Pro configuration, which now starts at $49,995.\n\n## Analysis\n\nTesla's pricing strategy for the Cybertruck could significantly impact its stock. If the Cybertruck is priced competitively, it could help Tesla gain a larger market share in the electric pickup truck market, which could boost its stock.\n\n## 8.

Leaked Tesla Cybertruck frame image shows disappointing design detail\n\nA leaked image of the Tesla Cybertruck frame reveals a design detail that has disappointed some observers: the absence of a cargo tunnel or pass-through from the bed to the cabin. This feature would have allowed for the extension of long materials from the bed into the cabin, increasing the vehicle's hauling capacity. The image also shows that the vehicle is fitted with an anti-corrosion coating, which is beneficial given that the Cybertruck is expected to be used as a construction vehicle and may operate in water. The final design details of the Cybertruck are yet to be revealed by Tesla.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* The leaked image shows no cargo tunnel or pass-through from the bed to the cabin.\n* The Cybertruck is fitted with an anti-corrosion coating.\n\n## 4.

      "selftext": "# 1. Tesla pondering 500k annual EV production in India: report\n\nTesla is reportedly discussing with the Indian government about an investment proposal to establish an electric vehicle (EV) factory in India. The proposed facility is expected to have a production capacity of 500,000 EVs per year.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Proposed production capacity: 500,000 EVs per year\n* Expected starting price for Tesla\u2019s vehicles in India: 2 million rupees (about $24,400)\n\n**Analysis:** The establishment of a factory in India could significantly increase Tesla's global market share and potentially boost its stock price. However, the expected starting price for Tesla\u2019s vehicles in India is significantly higher than that of local EVs, which could limit Tesla's market penetration in India.\n\n## 2. Tesla Model Y registrations are surging in the United States: study\n\nRegistrations of the Tesla Model Y in the United States have doubled year-over-year in the period between January and May 2023. The Tesla Model Y has played a significant role in this growth, with new registrations for the Model Y seeing a 103% increase.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Increase in Tesla Model Y registrations (Jan-May 2023 vs Jan-May 2022): 103%\n* Increase in Tesla Model 3 registrations (Jan-May 2023 vs Jan-May 2022): 18%\n* Percentage of new car registrations that are electric (Jan-May 2023): 7%\n\n**Analysis:** The significant increase in Model Y registrations indicates strong sales growth, which could positively impact Tesla's revenues and potentially boost its stock price. The growth in electric vehicle registrations suggests that Tesla is gaining market share in the auto industry.\n\n## 3. Tesla just made Wiper Controls easier than ever\n\nTesla has made its Wiper Controls more user-friendly in the latest software update. The company has added the ability to control the wipers from the steering wheel, making them more accessible.\n\n**Analysis:** Improvements in user experience, such as the easier control of wipers, can increase customer satisfaction and potentially boost sales, which could have a positive impact on Tesla's stock. Tesla's continuous innovation, as demonstrated by the upcoming Smart Auto Wipers, can enhance its reputation as a technology leader.\n\n## 4. Tesla's entry into India won't include duty waivers, gov't official says\n\nTesla's entry into the Indian market will not include duty waivers for imported vehicles, according to Sanjay Malhotra, the country's Revenue Secretary.\n\n**Analysis:** The lack of duty waivers could make it more expensive for Tesla to sell its vehicles in India, potentially limiting its market penetration and negatively impacting its stock. If Tesla decides to build a factory in India to avoid import duties, it would need to invest significantly in infrastructure, which could increase its operational costs.\n\n## 5. Tesla Model Y RWD now available in South Korea\n\nTesla has made the Model Y Rear Wheel Drive (RWD) available in South Korea. The entry-level all-electric crossover will be imported from Gigafactory Shanghai.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Model Y RWD starting price in South Korea: \u20a956,990,000 (roughly $45,100)\n* Estimated delivery date in South Korea: August to September 2023\n\n**Analysis:** The availability of the Model Y RWD in South Korea represents an expansion of Tesla's market, which could lead to increased sales and potentially boost its stock price. Importing vehicles from Gigafactory Shanghai could help Tesla reduce production costs and increase margins.\n\n## 6. Tesla NACS Hyundai adoption still on the table\n\nThe President of Hyundai Motor Company, Chung Jae-hoon, has stated that the South Korean automaker is still considering adopting Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS).\n\n**Analysis:** If Hyundai decides to adopt Tesla's NACS, it could increase the usage of Tesla's charging network, potentially generating more revenue and having a positive impact on Tesla's stock. If more automakers adopt Tesla's NACS, it could become an industry standard, enhancing Tesla's influence in the EV market.",

Tesla Giga Berlin looks to launch Phase 2 to reach 1M annual capacity\n\n**Summary**\n\nTesla's Gigafactory in Berlin is planning to launch its second phase, aiming to expand the plant's production capacity to one million vehicles per year. The company also intends to double its battery production facility's capacity from 50 GWh to 100 GWh per year.\n\n**Key Data**\n\n* Current production target: 500,000 Model Y units per year\n* Planned production capacity after Phase 2: 1,000,000 vehicles per year\n* Current battery production capacity: 50 GWh per year\n* Planned battery production capacity after expansion: 100 GWh per year\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe expansion could significantly boost Tesla's revenue and profitability, positively impacting its stock price. However, the expansion plan will need to go through another round of approval processes and public consultation, which could pose risks.\n\n## 2. Tesla's price cuts nearly wipe out Autonomy subscription service\n\n**Summary**\n\nTesla's recent price cuts have negatively impacted companies like Autonomy, which rents Teslas to customers on a subscription-based platform. The price cuts significantly diminished the value of Autonomy's fleet of Tesla vehicles, leading to a drop in fleet value from $85 million to around $56-57 million.\n\n**Key Data**\n\n* Autonomy's fleet value before Tesla's price cuts: $85 million\n* Autonomy's fleet value after Tesla's price cuts: $56-57 million\n* Current number of cars in Autonomy's fleet: 1,300\n* Number of cars needed to break even: 1,700\n\n**Analysis**\n\nWhile Tesla's price cuts have led to increased sales, they have negatively impacted companies like Autonomy. This could potentially affect Tesla's sales to these companies and its brand image, which might have an impact on its stock.\n\n## 3. Tesla looking to make about half million EVs annually in India, Times of India reports\n\n**Summary**\n\nTesla is reportedly in discussions with the Indian government about setting up a factory with an annual capacity to produce about half a million electric vehicles.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nIf Tesla successfully establishes a factory in India, it would mark a significant expansion into a new market, potentially boosting Tesla's sales and having a positive impact on its stock price. However, setting up a factory in India would involve navigating the country's regulatory environment and dealing with potential political risks.\n\n## 4.

Tesla warns Model 3 customers: federal tax credits likely reduced next year\n\nTesla has updated the Model 3's landing page to indicate that the vehicle's eligibility for the US Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) federal tax credit may be reduced after December 31, 2023. The Model 3 is currently the only vehicle in Tesla's S3XY lineup that carries this warning.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* The federal tax credit for the Model 3 may be reduced after December 31, 2023.\n* The Model 3 uses lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells from CATL, a China-based battery supplier.\n* Tesla is reportedly planning to build a battery plant in the U.S. with CATL.\n\n**Analysis:** The potential reduction in the federal tax credit for the Model 3 could create uncertainty among investors in the short term, potentially leading to volatility in Tesla's stock price. However, if Tesla's plans to build a battery plant in the U.S. with CATL come to fruition, this could be seen as a positive long-term strategy to maintain eligibility for federal tax credits, which could have a positive impact on Tesla's stock.\n\n## 2. Tesla Chair urges Australia to ignite tech startup revolution for economic growth\n\nTesla Chair Robyn Denholm, speaking at a business forum in Brisbane, emphasized that Australia should not indefinitely rely on its natural resources. Instead, she suggested that the country should foster an environment conducive to startups and innovation.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Australia's technology sector is expected to increase by 8% this year.\n* The sector is expected to reach 935,000 roles by February.\n\n**Analysis:** If Australia heeds Denholm's advice and fosters a more startup-friendly environment, this could lead to increased innovation in the tech sector, including electric vehicles and renewable energy. This could potentially benefit Tesla, leading to positive sentiment among investors and a potential boost to the stock.\n\n## 3. Tesla NACS mandate in TX deferred amid pushback\n\nTexas has deferred a vote that would grant federal funds for the construction of electric vehicle (EV) chargers due to opposition against the mandate to include Tesla's North America Charging Standard (NACS) at EV stations.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* The vote on the mandate to include Tesla NACS at EV stations in Texas has been deferred to August 16.\n\n**Analysis:** If the mandate to include Tesla NACS at EV stations is approved, it could lead to a standardization of charging infrastructure, which could potentially increase the adoption of electric vehicles. This could benefit Tesla and lead to a positive impact on its stock.\n\n## 4. Tesla\u2019s Boring Co. people mover seemingly teased in leaked video\n\nA leaked video has surfaced online, allegedly showing a prototype of a Tesla-made people mover for The Boring Company, Elon Musk's tunneling startup.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* The vehicle in the video appears to have 12 passenger seats and one driver's seat.\n\n**Analysis:** If the vehicle in the video is indeed a prototype for a Tesla-made people mover, it could indicate an expansion of Tesla's services beyond personal electric vehicles. This could potentially open up new revenue streams for Tesla, which could have a positive impact on its stock.\n\n## 5.

The supercomputer is expected to analyze vast amounts of sensor data from Tesla vehicles in real-world driving scenarios, which could lead to accelerated improvements in Autopilot and Full Self-Driving.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Dojo is expected to be among the top five supercomputers globally by January 2024.\n* It is projected to reach 100 exaflops by October 2024.\n\n## 2. Kentucky's New Law Mandates Tesla's Charging Technology To Secure Federal Funds\n\nKentucky has become the first state to mandate the use of Tesla's charging technology. The state requires EV charging companies to include Tesla's plug in their charging stations if they wish to participate in the state's program to electrify highways using federal funds.\n\n## 3. Tesla target upgraded but issues remain, suggests Jefferies\n\nJefferies, a US bank, has upgraded Tesla's share price target. However, the bank maintains that the issues that led to a drop in Tesla's share price last year have not been fully resolved.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Jefferies forecasts Tesla's second-quarter revenue to be around US$24.7 billion, a 6% increase quarter-on-quarter and a 46% increase year-on-year.\n* The bank also predicts underlying earnings of about US$2.68 billion, with gross auto margins at 18.6%, slightly lower than the first quarter.\n* Jefferies has set a new price target for Tesla at US$265.\n\n## 4. Tesla Rival Kia Has Awful News About Its Electric Vehicles\n\nSouth Korean electric vehicle (EV) maker Kia is facing an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) due to complaints about unexpected loss of power in their 2022 Kia EV6 models.\n\n## 5. Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven'\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 index is planning a special rebalance to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, which includes Tesla. The rebalance aims to address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* The special rebalance will take place before the market opens on Monday, July 24.\n* The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14.\n* Tesla's current weight in the Nasdaq 100 index is 4.5%.\n\n## 6.

This is a significant drop from the 17,400 insurance registrations that Tesla saw during the previous week, which ended July 4, 2023. However, this drop is not necessarily alarming as Tesla typically focuses on exporting vehicles to foreign territories in the early phases of a quarter.\n\n**Key Data:**\n\n* Tesla China's insurance registrations fell to 3,200 units in the week ending July 9, 2023.\n* Tesla China sold a total of 93,680 Shanghai-made cars in June.",

      "selftext": "# 1. Tesla investment in France gains support from Finance Minister\n\n**News**: France's Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, has expressed optimism that Tesla will make a significant investment in the country. The French government is making efforts to convince Tesla that France is the ideal location for their next factory, given the country's investment in the electric battery sector. While Tesla is still ramping up Gigafactory Berlin for European deliveries, there have been discussions about the company investing in another European Gigafactory. Last month, reports surfaced of Tesla negotiating the construction of a new \u20ac4.5 billion ($4.8 billion) Gigafactory in Valencia, Spain.\n\n**Analysis**: If Tesla decides to invest significantly in France, it could be seen as a positive move by the market. This could potentially lead to an increase in the stock price as it signals Tesla's commitment to expanding its production capabilities and market presence in Europe. However, it's important to note that such a large-scale investment also comes with risks and uncertainties.\n\n## 2. Tesla's Cybertruck Testing in Austin, Texas\n\n**News**: The Tesla Cybertruck was seen being driven around Austin, Texas, with CEO Elon Musk himself reportedly at the wheel. The Cybertruck is nearing production, with Tesla fine-tuning Giga Texas' lines and assigning staff for the vehicle's production. Cybertrucks have been spotted across the U.S. and even abroad, undergoing winter testing in New Zealand. Musk has previously stated that the Cybertruck has the potential to become Tesla's best vehicle to date. The recent sightings and Musk's personal test drive suggest that the final details of the pickup are being finalized.\n\n**Analysis**: The ongoing development and upcoming launch of the Cybertruck could diversify Tesla's product portfolio and open up new market opportunities. However, the success of the Cybertruck will depend on consumer acceptance of its unconventional design.\n\n## 3. Fisker's Expansion Plans\n\n**News**: Fisker plans to expand its EV lineup, despite reducing its production forecast for this year. The company has started delivering its Ocean SUV and plans to enter the entry-level EV market with its Pear small crossover. Fisker will also unveil its luxury EV sedan, the Ronin, in August.\n\n**Analysis**: Fisker's expansion could increase competition in the EV market, potentially impacting Tesla's market share and pricing power. However, Tesla's strong brand and technological leadership could help it maintain its competitive position.\n\n## 4. China's Car Sales in June\n\n**News**: China's passenger vehicle sales fell by 2.9% in June, but sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) jumped more than 25%. Tesla made record deliveries of its China-made vehicles in the second quarter.\n\n**Analysis**: The overall decrease in car sales in China could impact Tesla's sales in the region. However, the increase in NEV sales and Tesla's record deliveries could offset this impact. The economic recovery in China and the performance of Tesla's competitors will also influence Tesla's sales and stock price.\n\n## 5. China's Failed 'Truce' in EV Price War\n\n**News**: The China Association of Auto Manufacturers (CAAM) has retracted a pledge to avoid \"abnormal pricing\" in the EV market, breaking off a truce in a brutal price war. Tesla is still awaiting approval for a plan to boost output at its Shanghai plant.\n\n**Analysis**: The ongoing price war in China's EV market could put pressure on Tesla's profit margins. However, Tesla's ability to compete effectively in this price war could be seen as a positive sign. Tesla's plans to boost output at its Shanghai plant could also significantly influence its sales and stock price.\n\n## 6. Tesla Megapack Installation at Giga Texas\n\n**News**: Tesla is making significant progress in the buildout of the Megapack farm at Gigafactory Texas, with 24 of the 68 Megapacks already installed at the site.\n\n**Analysis**: The ongoing installation of the Megapack farm at Gigafactory Texas underscores Tesla's commitment to the energy storage market and could improve the operational efficiency of the factory. However, large-scale energy storage projects also come with regulatory and technical risks.\n\n## 7. Tesla China's Local Deliveries and Exports in June\n\n**News**: Tesla delivered 74,212 vehicles to the domestic auto market in China in June and exported a total of 19,468 cars. This includes a significant number of exports in the last month of Q2 2023, which represents a change in Tesla's typical delivery strategy.\n\n**Analysis**: Tesla's strong sales performance in China could be seen as a positive sign by the market. The change in Tesla's export strategy, including the addition of Canada as a destination for the Model Y, could potentially increase Tesla's global market reach and sales. However, the overall dynamics of the Chinese auto market will also play a significant role in influencing Tesla's sales and stock price.",

      "selftext": "This week, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has been the subject of numerous analyses and discussions, with a variety of perspectives and sentiments expressed by different analysts. Here's a summary of the key insights and analysis:\n\n## Bullish Sentiments\n\n1. **Leading the Path to Sustainable Energy:** Liang Zhao from Seeking Alpha expressed a bullish sentiment towards Tesla, believing that Tesla will continue to lead the path to sustainable energy. Tesla's sales performance vs its competitors will likely continue to drive the ups and downs of its stock price, and being able to accelerate its sales in China remains a key for Tesla\n2. **First-Mover Advantage:** Poonam A. Arora from Seeking Alpha also expressed a bullish sentiment, expecting Tesla to continue to dominate the EV market due to its first-mover advantage. She predicts that Tesla will produce 6 million cars by 2026, supported by revamped Model Ys and Model 3s, the ramp of the Cybertruck, and the significant roll-out of two new models, including the relatively lower-priced Model 2\n\n## Bearish Sentiments\n\n1. **Valuation Concerns:** Jordan Sauer from Seeking Alpha expressed a bearish sentiment towards Tesla, believing that Tesla's valuation is decoupled from its underlying growth prospects. He also expressed concern about Tesla's market share and margins facing pressure as consumers begin to realize that their favorite ICE auto brands are now offering much cheaper EVs\n2. **Profitability Concerns:** Kevin George from Seeking Alpha also expressed a bearish sentiment, raising concerns about Tesla's operating margins, which have slipped from 17.2% to 11.4% over three straight quarters. He suggests that a further drop in margins could push the company into negative cash flow territory\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nMelanie Schaffer from Benzinga provided a technical analysis of Tesla's stock, suggesting that Tesla's stock is settling into a possible bull flag pattern on the daily chart. The measured move of the bull flag is about 18%, which suggests Tesla could rise toward $322\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis week's analysis of Tesla presents a mixed bag of sentiments, with some analysts expressing bullish sentiments based on Tesla's future prospects and others expressing bearish sentiments due to concerns about Tesla's valuation and profitability.",

      "selftext": "Sure, here's a summary of the news and analysis\n\n1. **Tesla Layoffs at China Factory**: Tesla has begun to lay off some workers at its factory in China. This could potentially lead to a decrease in Tesla's stock price due to negative sentiment, impact on the company's image and sales in China, and concerns about future growth prospects. However, if the layoffs are part of a strategy to improve operational efficiency, it could be seen as a positive move by investors.\n2. **Tesla Offers Cash Rebate in China**: Amidst a price war in the EV market, Tesla has announced a new incentive to boost sales in China. This could potentially increase Tesla's sales, which could have a positive impact on the stock price. However, the rebate and the ongoing price war could put pressure on Tesla's profit margins, potentially negatively impacting the stock price.\n3. **Tesla's U.S. Dominance Continues**: Despite Hyundai overtaking General Motors in EV sales, Tesla continues to maintain its dominance in the U.S. market. This could potentially lead to an increase in Tesla's stock price as it indicates strong demand for Tesla's vehicles and the company's ability to outperform its competitors.\n4. **Mercedes-Benz Access to Tesla Supercharger Network**: Mercedes-Benz drivers will be able to use Tesla's Supercharger network in North America starting in 2024. This could provide Tesla with an additional source of revenue and enhance Tesla's brand recognition, potentially boosting the stock price.\n5. **Tesla Offers Referral Incentive in the UK**: Amidst the escalating price war in the EV market, Tesla has introduced a new referral scheme in the UK. This could potentially increase Tesla's sales globally, which could have a positive impact on the stock price. However, the referral discounts and the ongoing price war could put pressure on Tesla's profit margins, potentially negatively impacting the stock price.\n6. **Concerns Over Tesla's Operating Margins**: Ahead of Tesla's 2Q earnings, there are concerns over Tesla's operating margins and the impact of price cuts on revenue due to increasing competition in the EV market. These concerns could negatively impact the stock price.\n7. **Tesla Urges EPA to Finalize Tougher Emissions Rules**: Tesla is urging the Biden administration to finalize more stringent vehicle emissions limits. This could potentially boost the stock price if it gives Tesla a competitive advantage, but it could also lead to industry pushback, potentially negatively impacting the stock price.\n8. **Tesla Cybertruck Winter Testing**: Recent videos suggest that the Tesla Cybertruck performs well in snowy conditions. This could potentially increase the stock price by boosting investor confidence in the vehicle's capabilities, making it appealing to a wider range of customers, and indicating that Tesla is on track with its production timeline.\n\n&#x200B;",

      "selftext": "Seeing a lot of exuberance and enthusiasm here which is great, but also some future-price-target hopes which more or less seem like they are anchored around what the poster *paid* for their shares of Tesla, rather than being grounded in market cap considerations.\n\nHaving dealt with big institutional investment firms in a past life, they are (for right or wrong) going to base a lot of their sense of a price target off of potential future market capitalization - **not** what the share price is *today*.  This is why big Wall Street banks are often very focused on \"total addressable market\" share, opportunities, etc.\n\nSo instead of saying \"I bought my shares at $250 and I think they will get to $500!\" (because Cybertruck, energy, whatever) which is share-price focused thinking.  Flip your thinking around to anchor it off of market cap instead, and see if it still makes sense.\n\nMy handy rule-of-thumb is to multiply the share price \\* 3.17 to roughly estimate the market cap ... and see if that still makes sense.  For example, $300 a share would be a market cap of $951 billion.  [If you look here](https://companiesmarketcap.com/) that makes them bigger than Facebook, Eli Lilly, Visa, JP Morgan, etc.  Does that make sense to you?  (not speculating one way or another on that)\n\nAt $315 a share, that brings Tesla back into the $1T valuation club.  Do you think big Wall Street companies will have trouble envisioning that for a while?  I do.  I think there will be a lot of resistance keeping it below $315 for a while.  That's just my opinion.\n\nAt $500 a share now you're saying it's bigger than Google.  At $1,000 a share it's at Apple / Microsoft / Saudi Aramco levels of huge.  Does that make sense to you?  If so, in what timeframe?  6 months?  12 years?\n\nIMO, everyone should always base their assessments on Tesla's future stock price based on their overall quarterly performance (of course), but anchor it as well in terms of overall market cap.  Because that's what the deep pockets do.",

[Audi's EV Production Plans in Mexico](https://www.teslarati.com/audi-announce-ev-production-plans-mexico/): Audi's plan to start EV production in Mexico could increase competition in the EV market, potentially impacting Tesla's market share negatively. However, Audi's entry could also expand the overall EV market, which could benefit Tesla. The net score was -2, suggesting a slightly negative impact on Tesla's stock price.\n2. [Tesla's Strong Sales in China](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-china-june-results-disperse-doubts-ev-sector/): Tesla's impressive sales performance in China could boost investor confidence and positively impact the stock price. The easing of concerns about supply chain disruptions and weak consumer demand for EVs could also be a positive signal for investors. The net score was +10, suggesting a positive impact on Tesla's stock price.\n3. [Tesla Cybertruck's Rear Light Bar](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-rear-light-bar-confirmed-video/): The confirmation of the rear light bar in the Cybertruck and the increased sightings of the vehicle suggest that it may be entering its initial production soon. This could be seen as a positive signal that Tesla is making progress on its production plans. The net score was +10, suggesting a positive impact on Tesla's stock price.\n4. [Tesla Model Y's Sales Performance in Iceland and Australia](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-y-best-selling-iceland-australia/): The Model Y's strong sales performance in both Iceland and Australia could boost investor confidence and positively impact Tesla's stock price. Tesla's ability to penetrate different markets and become a top-selling brand is a positive signal for its global growth strategy. The net score was +10, suggesting a positive impact on Tesla's stock price.\n\nOverall, the news articles suggest a generally positive outlook for Tesla, with potential challenges from increased competition. However, Tesla's strong sales performance and progress in vehicle production could boost investor confidence and positively impact the stock price.\n\nGiven these factors, Tesla is rated as a \"Hold\" or \"Buy\". A \"Hold\" rating could be justified by the increased competition and short-term decrease in profitability. On the other hand, a \"Buy\" rating could be justified by the strong sales performance in key markets and the high anticipation for the Cybertruck.",

And it raises important and interesting questions.  \n\n\nI was reading that some suggesting there may be no stocks available if this rush continues for a longer period. If that turns out to be true, then is it conceivable that Tesla share price may likely go up to unrealistic levels? Of course, increasing the shares is easy to solve that challenge. But what happens to real value when stock price ends up in levels that misrepresent Tesla Inc., value by business shifts in favor of the many competitors in the market.  \n\n\nI can imagine a scenario where TOO many buyers/investors with the intention of holding the stock for long term... could push and cause the problem. I can think this situation in produce markets and the futures market. When Demand overwhelms Supply, inflation results. In important and necessary products this becomes a real problem. Can the Market balance the picture should that be the sole challenge. I find this interesting. Also a wait to buy when share price falls may may not be a good idea should share price keep going higher when this phenomenon becomes a real challenge.  \n\n\nDoes anybody have an idea of similar and comparable situation. Obviously more securities are printed in the end. I heard recently a friend who worked in the insurance business say that it's easy and fast to sell insurance papers to raise easy money in the market, lol. And when the company faces a disaster when multiple participants are hit simultaneously, the company goes bankrupt. The larger risk is on the insured who may lose property... and life.  \n\n\nTesla shares may really make millions... millionaires.  \n\n\nSome stats for Tesla:  \n\n\n**\"P/E RATIO 75.39**  \n**PEG RATIO 1.72**  \n**PRICE TO BOOK 16.90**  \n**PRICE TO CASH FLOW 54.39**  \n**PRICE TO FREE CASH FLOW 124.80**  \n**TOTAL SALES (TTM) 86.035 B**  \n**REVENUE PER SHARE (TTM) 24.81**  \n**SHARES OUTSTANDING 3,169.5 M**  \n**SHARE FLOAT (%) 2,755.11 M (86.93%)**  \n**% HELD BY INSTITUTIONS 43.29** ",

      "selftext": "As everyone on this sub knows - Tesla will be releasing the 2Q delivery numbers this weekend - seems that the street is looking for 445,000 as a high and 430,000 as a low.  I think with all the incentives this past quarter and all of the push to sell cars (aggressively) that Tesla will surprise and come in with 470,000 deliveries. \n\nLet me state facts:\n\n1) I made the jump and leased a 2023 model S in early May because the 3 year unlimited free charging was appealing\u2026The price point at around 89k was attractive compared to the Porsche Taycan over 120k and Lucid Air over 100k.  \n\nAlso the entry level 3 and Y have the full $7500 tax credit and are extremely affordable - also 3 month unlimited charging.  \n\n2) The tremendous amount of superchargers in the network helped alleviate the fear of \u201cnot finding a power source\u201d.  Put a novice mind at ease knowing there is a Tesla supercharger everywhere and not driving aimlessly looking for one.  \n\n3) I walked into a Tesla showroom at a mall in Scottsdale, AZ and the place was packed ( early June ). Furthermore, the employees (salespeople) were aggressively asking me questions and seemed incentivized to make sales.  Although they don\u2019t get individual commissions they have a point structure / reward system established to tally and bonus salespeople that sell cars.  Given I had an S already I inquired about an X for my wife - the sales person called me 2 times and texted me 3 times to follow up and see if I was ready to order.  This was unlike any previous Tesla showroom experience I had in the past where uninterested snowflakes just stood around looking bored or bothered if you dared ask questions.  \n\nThesis : Tesla and the employees are motived to move cars and push the company forward.  Given macro events ( war, inflation, stagnant global growth) I believe Tesla has incredible name brand recognition and the \u201cit factor\u201d.  I think they beat the street number by a wide margin and the stock gaps up Monday morning.  \n\nAll Just my opinion not financial advice.",

      "selftext": "Welcome my weekly $TSLA update.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1)** **Volkswagen confirms talks with Tesla over NACS charging standard.**\n\nVolkswagen is considering using Tesla's charging connector for its electric vehicles in North America, potentially joining Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS). The company is currently in talks with Tesla about adopting this connector for its Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, and future Scout brands in the region.\n\n**2)** **Tesla set for record quarter in China.**\n\nAnalysts predict that Tesla is likely to achieve a new sales record in China despite competition from local rivals. Estimates suggest Tesla could sell around 155,000 cars in China from April to June, marking a 13% increase from the previous quarter, although its market share may decline slightly due to increased competition from companies like BYD and Aion.\n\n**3) Tesla sales forecast for Q2: 440,000-450,000 deliveries.**\n\nAs the second quarter comes to a close, Tesla remains the dominant force in the electric vehicle market, with estimated sales forecasts for Q2 ranging from 441,000 to 448,000 vehicles. The Model Y is expected to outpace other models, and while Tesla's production is increasing, concerns arise regarding the gap between production and deliveries. The upcoming release of the Cybertruck and a lower-cost Tesla model are seen as crucial for sustaining Tesla's growth.\n\n**4)** **Elon vs. Zuck: it's officially happening.**\n\nTech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have engaged in social media banter about a potential cage fight between them, generating publicity and attention. However, it remains uncertain whether the fight will actually take place, and some speculate that the discussion may serve as a distraction from recent negative news surrounding Meta's decision to cut off news access in Canada and Musk's declining reputation--according to data from Morning Consult.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PS:** links + update in your inbox every week, [here](https://teslafolder.beehiiv.com/).",

      "selftext": "Main point:\nWhat's everyone's opinion on where TSLA gows from here (and why, technicals, etc)? Most tech stocks recovered after 2pm -2:30pm, is this bull run over for TSLA? I sincerely hope this was just a red day after so many green. \nPersonally:\n I'm holding onto 25 252 calls (exp 6/23 ... Ugh, ik)... I got stuck in the mess today, I didn't expect such a drop from the Fed announcement, my mistake, and while most tech stocks recovered, TSLA did not. I only recently started playing TSLA, ive always watched it, and hold some stock long, but I am no expert. I am beating myself up pretty hard rn... Was wondering what this sub thought. I have the decay to worry about, along w the stock price, obviously.  I'm afraid when I pull out to the monthly I'm seeing a bearish pendant form, there's been massive large scale selling both 2 days ago and today, but I also know that TSLA defies the odds on the regular. Any thoughts/advice/opinions? Im really pissed at myself for this one.\nInterested to hear this sub's insight.",

      "selftext": "I made a lot of money on TSLA just riding volatility with big call plays and then lost half of that 13 months ago when it tumbled before the split and that's after I cut the rope on my calls and bought puts to save my ass on the way down. I tinkered tentatively after that until it went below $100 and made a big call move to put me back on the horse.\n\nBasically, I've been okay at understanding the TSLA sentiment and spotting coordinated FUD efforts that spurred the volatility so that I could profit from it. Right now there is a coordinated circle jerk going on and I don't know why and I don't know for sure what it means for the stock price. Ark saying $2k, Semi going to some semi thing, Ford admitting they lose $70k on every lightning and all but saying Ford E exists so Ford Blue can go bankrupt (everyone on Earth should be short the `F`), Mega Pack 2XL, Model 3 LR coming back, etc.\n\nMy own price target is in-line with Ark and I shifted all-in on Tesla for my long position when it hit $100 to the point that I took the tax penalty on some old 401k accounts rather than roll them in to my current 401k and folded them into my brokerage account instead of shifting them to a growth fund including TSLA. I think it is clear that TSLA is a long position win for at least a 5X and I put better than 50:50 odds on a 10X in 3 years. But I didn't make my money from a long position, I made it on TSLA options. I'm already in on some calls on Wednesday and even though we had a big bump already today, I just picked up more. Something is in the air and it's either a crazy rug pull or the first signs that the market is realizing TSLA isn't a hype stock.",

      "selftext": "Long time reader, first time poster. Sorry for any formatting issues.\n\nI have two main questions about recent events and SpaceX related to the current TSLA share price.\n\nFor clarity, I hold TSLA as about 10% of my total portfolio and am very bullish on the future. This is just me being curious and trying to understand the public's point of view. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Within the recent earnings report, margins and earnings were lower than expected due to recent price drops. I feel this is a huge reason for the decline in share price throughout the last few days. From what I've read, Elon is okay with lowering margin on current sales because it can be made up in the future with additional $10k FSD sales once that is fully up and running. Why are people not accounting for 10K FSD sales on most vehicles in the future? Its basically free margin for every car that purchases FSD. With an additional $10k margin on FSD sales in the future, I feel like the public should have more faith in the stock long term. Is my view of this additional $10k per FSD sale looking too far ahead in the future? I see this current share price dip as a huge buying opportunity because people are creating fear of current margins and not accounting for an additional $10k FSD sales. Maybe my view is wrong, or too far out, but I'm curious if others are accounting for an additional $10k FSD sale within their own analysis. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) More unrelated, because SpaceX. Why are a lot of people/articles so focused on the test launch explosion and creating fear within the TSLA stock? Elon basically stated their mission was to gather information from the launch, and that he nearly expected this thing to blow up. In my eyes, this was a huge victory that the rocket did not explode sooner. I feel that people are taking the explosion into consideration with the TSLA share price and creating fear within the marketplace for no reason. Major news outlets see an explosion and think something terrible has happened, while in reality, SpaceX gathered the information they needed before the explosion occurred. People who just read the mainstream news articles are not getting the full story. Is this bullish view incorrect on my part?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo sum it up, 1) yes margins are currently low, but it can be made up in the future with FSD sales. The cheaper the car, the more Tesla can sell, which leads to more 'free' margin on FSD sales. \n\nAnd 2) Why are people creating fear from the test launch explosion? SpaceX got what they needed, and are progressing in the large picture. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo hate coming from me, I'm a huge Elon/Tesla/SpaceX fan, just more curious on the specifics of recent events to see if my long term view is on the right track. \n\nThank you!",

      "selftext": "(U.S.) I'm both a long-term investor in TSLA as well as a trader. I consider myself and investor first and trader second (although as you'll soon discover, not a very wise trader). I have a Roth IRA where I accumulate TSLA shares and let that account ebb and flow with the tides and hopefully, by the time I retire, TSLA will have a multi-trillion dollar market cap.\n\nI also have a cash brokerage account on the side - a non-retirement account. I basically view this as my side money. I can only contribute $6000 per year to the Roth, so anything else needs to be done in a different account. Since TSLA is the only company I know and love, I trade in and out of the stock in this non-retirement account. My plan was to see if I could take advantage of TSLA's volatility. I thought I was doing okay. I would sell at the peaks and buy back for lower prices, reducing my cost basis, right? Wrong. I was accumulating more shares, yes. But the IRS doesn't let you claim the losses unless you wait a month to repurchase. Repurchasing within 31 days is called a wash sale. In other words, they tax your gains and don't let you claim the losses unless you wait 31 days. So all of 2022 I was creating a nice big tax bill for myself without knowing. To add insult to injury, TSLA went from ~$400/share to $100/share, now back up to ~$200. Not only do I have a nice fat tax bill this year, I have half the money I did since the peak. (Although, I guess many of us TSLA can say the same thing). \n\nOne way of getting around the wash sale rule is to buy into ETFs and mutual funds. So, the next best thing in my view is ARKK or ARKQ. They have a large TSLA position and they think like I do. So now, if and when I sell for a loss, I will re-buy into one of the ARK funds until a month has passed and I can re-invest into TSLA. I may even get lucky on the timing, but who knows - I could get unlucky just as easily.",

The firm sold 119,630 shares from its **ARK Innovation ETF** and 20,012 shares from the **ARK Next Generation Internet ETF**. \n\n The sale ended a Tesla buying streak for Wood. ARK added $12.6 million in Tesla stock on March 8 after snatching up 1.3 million shares in December and January, according to Barron's data. Tesla shares on Thursday closed up 5.5% higher than their March 8 closing price, and 1% below their close from Dec. 1. Tesla stock is up 56% so far this year. \n\n Meanwhile, ARK Invest added 268,928 shares of Coinbase, worth $17.83 million based on Thursday's closing price of 66.30. ARK added 230,599 shares to ARKK and 38,329 shares to ARKW, respectively. \n\n COIN stock unraveled 14% on Thursday after the company announced it received a Wells Notice from the SEC late Wednesday, a warning that the regulator intends to recommend enforcement action for potential securities violations. Coinbase and its executives remain adamant their products comply with regulations. \n\n On March 21, Wood sold 160,887 shares of Coinbase from the **ARK Fintech Innovation ETF** to mark ARK's first COIN stock sale of the year. \n\n COIN stock slid another 4.5% premarket Friday. Coinbase shares had catapulted 97% year-to-date as of Thursday's close. But rattled by crypto panics, Coinbase stock remains well below its all-time-high of 368.90 from Nov. 9, 2021. \n\n Wood and ARK also purchased 320,557 shares of payment processor **Block**, worth $19.84 million based on Thursday's close of 61.88.

Commenting on it, Tesla bull **Cathie Wood**\u2019s **Ark Invest** analyst said the event offered \u201cno flash, all substance.\u201d\n\n**What Happened:** There was no shortage of important and exciting news from the event, said Ark Invest analysts **Tasha Keeney** and **Sam Korus.** As opposed to the expectations of many investors, who anticipated a \u201cflashy glimpse\u201d of its next-gen vehicle, Tesla shared \u201cnews more profound than a product prototype,\u201d Keeney said.\n\n***See Also:*** *Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock*\n\nThe analyst pointed to the \u201croadmap for continuous cost declines associated with scaling production.\u201d\n\n**Costs To Be Cut In Half:** Tesla will likely deliver on interdependent actions that would reduce vehicle costs by about 50% over the next five years, the analyst said.\n\n**Keeney outlined three steps that the company will take to accomplish this:**\n\n* 1) Producing 100% of the controllers on its next-generation vehicles.\n* 2) Switching to a 48-volt battery architecture that will likely reduce power losses by 16-fold.\n* 3) Using local ethernet-connected controllers to reduce the complexity of the wiring harness.\n* \u201cThese electrical architecture changes should cut costs and give Tesla more control over its supply chain at the component level,\u201d Keeney said. These steps will also help the company transition its manufacturing to a parallel assembly process, reducing manufacturing footprint and wasted time by 40% and 30%, respectively, she added.\n\nThe reduction in factory footprint, according to the analyst, will likely help Tesla accelerate **Gigafactory** production, increasing the scaling velocity of both its fleet and data engine.\n\n**Data Gives Edge Over Rivals:** The analyst noted that relative to **General Motors Corp.**\u2019s (NYSE: GM) **Cruise** and **Alphabet\u00a0Inc.**\u2019s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) **Waymo**, Tesla vehicles have traveled about 100 times the cumulative miles and have collected about 50,000 times the data. Ark\u2019s research showed that data will be critical in the race to create and scale a fully autonomous taxi service, Keeney added.\n\n\u201cIn short, Tesla\u2019s vertical integration seems to have given the company an edge that may take its less-integrated competitors years \u2014 if ever \u2014 to replicate,\u201d the analyst said.",

This week has a lot of information, so I've condensed it down for this post to keep it value packed. You can view the [full article here](https://news.thecompounder.co/tesla-news-feb-05-2023)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. EXPLOSION**  \nA Tesla Model S in California has allegedly spontaneously caught fire. The fire took 6000 gallons of water to put out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. FORD COMPETES**  \nFord is cutting prices of its Mustang Mach-E by $5,900.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. GIGA MEXICO**  \nA new Gigafactory in Mexico could be coming soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. BITCOIN LOSS**  \nTesla recorded a $204 million loss on Bitcoin. Tesla initially invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, but the latest filing as of December 2022 states the company now holds around $191 million.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. AUSTRALIA SUPERCHARGER CHANGES**  \nTesla has opened their Supercharging network to other vehicles in Australia.\u00a0This is still a pilot program before they bring it permanently to North America, but this is the first country outside Europe to test the program.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6. INCREASED SPENDING**  \nTesla plans to spend between $6B-$8B this year and $7B-$9B in 2024 and 2025 - that's a lot of dough!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7. MODEL S/X CHANGES**  \nTesla is incentivizing existing Model S/X owners to purchase another Tesla. The incentive is to trade in your Model S/X and receive a $3,000 discount or 3 years of free supercharging.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**8. MORE CREDIT**  \nTesla now has a $5 Billion revolving line of credit (with 5 year maturity), implying their credit status is strong. There's also reports that tis could increase by another $2 Billion - for $7 Billion total.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**9. STRONG SHANGHAI DEMAND**  \nTesla is looking to increase Giga Shanghai's capacity in a response to strong demand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**10. MODEL Y #4**  \nTesla's Model Y is the 4th best selling car of 2022 (including non-EVs).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**11. LOBBYING IN CANADA**  \nTesla is lobbying the Ontario, Canada government on the plan to spend $91 million for EV infrastructure. As of right now, Tesla's superchargers are not included in this program and Tesla wants to change this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**12. DOJ INVESTIGATION**  \nThe DOJ is investigating Tesla's Autopilot and FSD software.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**13. SOLAR PARTNERS**  \nTesla is taking applications for Solar Roof Partners to expand this segment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**14. NEW OFFICE FOR AI**  \nTesla appears to be opening a new office in Silicon Valley to hire local talent for their AI development.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**15. TESLA CHINA SALES**  \nTesla sold 66,051 units in China in January. This results in a 10.37% YoY increase in unit sales.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**16. MUSK NOT LIABLE**  \nThe court ruled that Elon Musk is not held liable for his tweet in 2018 about funding secured for Tesla.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**17. CYBERTRUCK LEAKS**  \nThe Cybertruck is the most anticipated release in years from Tesla. We got some new leaked images and a video this week on the truck, and a new piece of information on a unique feature - the Cybertruck will have a triangular shape for it's side mirrors and they will be removable as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**18. ANALYST CHANGES**  \nOne analyst changed their rating this week - Berenberg has a BUY rating and $200 PT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***That's it for this weeks TSLA news!*** IMO, increased credit line and strong Shanghai demand are strong bull cases for TSLA to rocket higher this year. The other pieces of news are mostly good as well, but not as impactful (right now at least).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFound this useful?

      "selftext": "Hello fellow TSLA investors, kinda new to this but I have a few shares. I put together some basic thoughts.\n\nMy confidence in TSLA's future has never been higher than it is right now. \n\nSustained Growth: Tesla has shown steady growth in both their revenue and profitability. The company's last quarterly report showed a 56% increase in revenue over the previous year. This trend looks likely to continue.\n\nWide Moat: Tesla has a strong brand and reputation that makes them competitively superior to traditional car manufacturers. The company's focus on innovation, customer satisfaction, and sustainability has set them apart from traditional car companies. Consequently, Tesla has developed a devoted customer base.\n\nDiversification: Tesla gives consumers more than just electric cars. They make solar panels and batteries as well. This allows them to be more resilient to the economy and make additional money.\n\nHuge Market Potential: Tesla has a huge market potential for their electric vehicles. Their vehicles have great performance, amazing style, and an enormous market. The demand for Tesla's cars will increase as the world's governments implement more electric cars.\n\nStrong Leadership: Elon Musk is a visionary entrepreneur and proven leader whose passion for technology, space exploration and sustainability has impacted many. His strong leadership abilities have driven his company forward and will continue to do so moving forward. But we have a good backup in Tom Zhu.\n\nAs a believer in Tesla's long-term success, I\u2019m confident in my investment. No company is guaranteed success, but I believe TSLA has a strong foundation and a bright future ahead.\n\nWhat do you think about Tesla's prospects for the coming weeks?",

Here's this weeks news:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. BRAND NEW GIGA**Giga Nevada is coming!\n\nThis new factory would be a $3.6B investment for Tesla, with the primary purpose being to build the new Semi Trucks. There will also be a 100GWh 4680 cell factory at this location (as more Tesla's continue to be sold with 4680).\n\n**2. EARNINGS SUMMARY**Tesla released their Q4 2022 earnings and results came in strong.\n\nHere's the summary:\n\n1. Revenue was $24.32B (+37% YoY)\n2. Gross Margins (Auto) was 25.9% (-466bps YoY)\n3. Operating Cash Flow (OCF) was $3.29B (-29% YoY), and Free Cash Flow (FCF) was $1.42B (-49% YoY)\n4. For FY 2022, Revenue grew 51% YoY, OCF was $14.7B, FCF was $7.6B, and they hit record deliveries of 1.31M units.\u00a0\n\n**3. STRONG Y DEMAND**A research report by M Science revealed that the Model Y was seeing strong demand in the US. We got more clarity (and confirmation) on the Tesla ER Call that demand is strong.\n\n**4. WASHINGTON ON EV'S**Musk met with top White House officials last week to discuss EV's.\n\nThe goal was to figure out a solution for Tesla and the current administration to work together to grow EV adoption. Spending for EV infrastructure has been a sticking point, as this is far behind where it should be (when looking outside Tesla's supercharging network) but Musk is trying to stress the importance of focusing resources\u00a0to build this out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's it for Tesla news this week!\n\nIf you're interested in seeing these updates weekly on reddit, let me know.

      "selftext": "*tldr: TSLA is a volatile stock around earnings, I study past earnings moves numbers and calibrate a non-directional position looking at break-evens and projected P&Ls.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis week I looked at TSLA as a possible play for their earnings releasing Wednesday after close. My usual approach is to start by comparing the stock move on past earnings versus current expected move then look at some positions.\n\n# Past Earnings Moves\n\nA good first step is to start by looking at past earnings moves for the stock.\n\nLet's start with the main numbers:\n\n>***Average post move***: **+/-7%*****Std deviation***: **4%**\n\nStandard deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of values.\n\nA quick approximation is that most values are as low as average minus this, and as high as average plus this.\n\n**\u21d2 TSLA moves between +/-3% and +/-11% on its earnings.**\n\nWe can refine these numbers by looking at the breakdown of these past moves:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j374ujf414ea1.png?width=2044&format=png&auto=webp&s=4acf8a16c59ab1a45d73935878d7585028a40416\n\nEvery line is a past earnings of TSLA showing data about that release date. We see the average and standard deviation calculated on those date.\n\n>**\u21d2 We can assess that 7% average and 4% std dev stayed grew over the last two years from around \\~5%**\n\nFor every date we have the pre-release / day-of-release / post-release actual moves, this time not absolute. Pre / Post moves are highest recorded move leading to / after the release by one day.\n\nHighlighted rows are dates where the move on day of release exceeded the past average value.\n\n>**\u21d2 We see since 2018, the lowest move recorded was +15.1% on 2021-10-19.**\n\nWe can assess if these dates correspond to perhaps other events that pushed those moves as outliers or whether the stock is more unpredictable on when its spikes on earnings.\n\nA good way of investigating this is looking at histograms charts:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7lmuoab314ea1.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cce6cb6982844fdc97db1b0358ca6a601831fa8\n\nThis a distribution of the past moves we were looking at. The x axis is the value of the move and the y axis is how many it occurred, *so spikes correspond to the highest occurrences*.\n\n>**\u21d2 Most historic moves are concentrated between -10 and +10, with however many occurrences of peaks at +15% and drops at -16%, and overall a very volatile stock on earnings**\n\nGiven these informations, we can start looking at possible plays for betting on the stock moving higher than the past average of +/-7% as this is a volatile stock on earnings - if we can find a suitable trade in terms of break-even.\n\nOne thing to always keep in mind is the IV crush: implied volatility rises in the days leading to the earnings release which makes holding options positions through earnings risky where I.V drops significantly right after the release, inflicting a high loss on long options positions if the stock price does not exceed the implied move.\n\nStock price at the time of this write-up is 143.1$, near close Tuesday , so closest strikes is the143$ for the closest expiration of 01-27.\n\n# TSLA 01-27 143p 143c\n\n[***link to position***](https://app.earnings-watcher.com/#/positions?symbol=TSLA&pos=TSLA.147.0.c.01-27;;s;;)\n\nWe see the straddle is showing a small delta of 0.08 and a gamma of 0.15: this position is non-directional, meaning it gets affected in the same way wether the stock moves up or down. Gamma shows us how *fast* that reaction is.\n\nLooking at IV, the call IV is 108% vs 110% for the put. **These values of IV are not informative on their own: they need to be compared to historic IV around earnings, and more importantly, we need to know how they will impact any position when IV drops after earnings. This translates into thee break-even of the position and its p&l for different scenarios of stock moves, and that's what we will be looking into**\n\nThis is the position break-even, calculated for exactly Thursday, taking into account the drop of IV for this position from 110% to 80%:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2l3gwm214ea1.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=b07014d95702256258234829e23fd84feff9da6e\n\n>**Break-even**: **-9% +7.8%**\n\nThis is a bit higher than the average historic move of +/-7% and skewed to the downward side given the strikes and IV.\n\n**Worst case scenario of no stock move will yield a -50% loss:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ujn9g91214ea1.png?width=3100&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e44935012c8d6abc445b8cc06112f73616de1a8\n\n# We can better estimate maximum profit and loss\n\nLet's look at P&Ls for minimum and maximum historic moves from the analysis earlier.\n\n>**Minimum move of +/-0% => P&L: -50%**  \n>  \n>**Minimum move of +/-3% => P&L: -38%**  \n>  \n>**Maximum move of +/-11% => P&L: +50%**  \n>  \n>**Moonshot move of +/-15% => P&L: +70%**\n\n*This can be used to calibrate stop-loss and take-profit thresholds with some margin:*\n\n**Aggressive** (willing to hold for maximum move even through no move at the beginning)\n\nTake-profit: +50% | Stop-Loss: -50%\n\n**Mild** (happy with just an average past move, and cutting it if the move is a bit over the minimum)\n\nTake-profit: 30% | Stop-Loss: -30%\n\n**A good practice is to not activate the stop less in the first hour to give the market time to react, then we either exit at stop loss or take profit,** we are ready for the potential loss so might as well give ourselves more room since most of the loss will occur at open.\n\nLet's see if we can lower the potential loss of 50% and perhaps our break-even too by selling some out-of-money legs.\n\n# TSLA 01-27 long143p 143c short 148c 138p\n\n[***link to position***](https://app.earnings-watcher.com/#/positions?symbol=TSLA&pos=TSLA.143.0.c.01-27;;TSLA.143.0.p.01-27sTSLA.148.0.c.01-27;;TSLA.138.0.p.01-27)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jlnwrn8z04ea1.png?width=3104&format=png&auto=webp&s=08a9651e31b835895606bfef81d0732dea5bc881\n\nBreak-even is now lower at -7.2% +6% which is lower than the average historic of +/-7%, and we lowered our potential loss to -15%, but on the other hands we also reduced our potential gains:\n\n>**Minimum move of +/-0% => P&L: -15%**  \n>  \n>**Minimum move of +/-3% => P&L: -10%**  \n>  \n>**Maximum move of +/-11% => P&L: +10%**  \n>  \n>**Moonshot move of +/-15% => P&L: +15%**\n\nHope this is helpful, lemme know if you have any questions!\n\nData from [*EarningsWatcher*](https://earnings-watcher.com/)",

By following the steps outlined below, you can set up a system that can help you execute trades based on specific criteria, freeing up your time to focus on other tasks and reduce anxiety over short term fluctuations or the feeling of missing out on moves.\u00a0\n\nThere are a plethora of different options available for setting up auto trading, but this is a process that has proven effective for me. \n\nHere's how it works in a nutshell:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gi08vopr5maa1.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=f93909c275082a888a57f0d9a4c23128ae3907c4\n\n* Getting signals in TradingView: The first step in the process is to set up a TradingView account and configure it to receive signals for $TSLA. There are a variety of ways to do this, including subscribing to signal providers or using custom scripts to generate signals based on specific criteria.\n* Sending signals via webhook to Capitalise.ai: Once you have received a signal in TradingView, the next step is to send it to Capitalise.ai via a webhook. This allows the capital management platform to receive and process the signal, preparing it for execution by bots.\n* Bots execute the trades via API to the broker: Finally, the bots use the API of a brokerage firm to execute the trade based on the signal received from TradingView. This allows the trade to be executed automatically, without the need for manual intervention.",
