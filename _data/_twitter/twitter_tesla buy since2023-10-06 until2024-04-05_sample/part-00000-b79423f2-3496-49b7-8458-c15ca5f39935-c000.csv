Here are our TOP 3 reasons why:

1. Rust. 

Not only is it time-consuming to grind the rust off the paint every morning before work, but I’ve had to buy an industrial-grade sander that keeps breaking due to the uneven paneling throughout.

2. Trunk.

We sold our F-250 Super Duty Diesel to get this “Rust-Bucket Spaceship” and the trunk is MUCH smaller in comparison to our Ford. There is also this French door on the trunk that random people keep trying to stand on. It’s 👏🏼ANNOYING👏🏼.

3. Elon.

We are an American family. We buy American. This Elon guy comes over to our country, takes our jobs, and builds these foreign cars. I don’t know about you but I buy American-made everything. 

For those interested, I’m selling the Cybertruck for what I owe on it.

2024-04-03T06:05:03+00:00,"Should I Buy Tesla Stock as It Dips?
Navigating the Turbulence: Tesla's Stock Dilemma

Since the dawn of 2024, Tesla has found itself amidst a financial whirlwind, struggling to keep pace with its counterparts in the elite group often referred to as the \"Magnificent Seven\". This term, embodying a collection of high-flying tech companies, now sees Tesla lagging behind, stirring a pot of concerns and opportunities among investors. With Tesla's shares taking a hit, the critical question arises: Is now the opportune moment to invest in Tesla stock?

The current dip in Tesla's stock value has sparked a wave of speculative analysis, with investors and financial enthusiasts debating the company's future trajectory. On the one hand, the drop presents a potentially lucrative buy-in point, assuming Tesla rebounds as it has historically done after previous downturns. Conversely, the underlying reasons for Tesla's underperformance this year raise valid concerns about the company's near-term prospects.

Deciphering the Dip: A Closer Look
Before making an investment decision, it's crucial to understand the factors contributing to Tesla's current predicament. Production issues, competition intensification, and market saturation play pivotal roles. However, Tesla's innovation track record, expansion plans, and the electric vehicle (EV) market's growth prospects remain strong indicators of its long-term value.

Investment Considerations  📈 📉

Market Dynamics: 
The EV sector's exponential growth trajectory suggests a robust market demand that Tesla is well-positioned to capitalize on despite current challenges.

Innovation and Expansion: 
Tesla's commitment to innovation and global market expansion could drive future profits, making the current stock price a potential bargain.

Risk Assessment: 
Investors must weigh Tesla's current challenges against its growth potential. Considering the volatility inherent in tech and auto industry stocks, a long-term perspective is essential.

Conclusion: To Buy or Not to Buy?
Investing in Tesla at its current lower price point could offer significant returns for those with a long-term investment horizon. However, it's imperative to conduct thorough research, consider Tesla's position within the broader market trends, and assess your risk tolerance before deciding.

I really appreciate your support.💯
