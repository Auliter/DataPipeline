With software, FSD, batteries, solar and green energy.\n\nAuto makes up >85% of top line sales.  It is what it is.  The numbers are gravity which bring you back to reality.\n\nForward looking narratives and an investment thesis rooted in an optimistic future is great.  But, it needs to be grounded in fundamentals.  End rant.  Open to counter points, learning more and being open minded if you have anything you think I'm getting wrong.\n\nRed = total auto revenues\nblue = energy gen + storage\norange = share price",

        "rawContent": "some things for me (I'm on the fence for a model Y):\n\n- FSD is a primary benefit of a Tesla but 12k is way too much for it, especially for an incomplete product that you are personally training for them\n- $1k extra for whiter interior of same material is too much\n- you can't buyout your leased car\n\nTesla attempts to appeal to a market that prides itself on \"feeling smart\". But if you actually buy one, there's a high risk you find yourself feeling stupid.  That's a bad setup! Tesla is trying to create a new market. The way to do that is to create such a good deal that people would feel stupid NOT to buy it.\n\nIf instead you take every opportunity you can to nickel and dime people in every place you \"provide value\" (even if it costs you next to nothing), people will feel that and look elsewhere.\n\nKeep in mind that the tradeoff of an EV is:\n- Half-hour+ refueling time\n- Fewer places on the road you can fuel your car quickly\n- Fewer places that can fix your car if something is wrong with it\n- $1500+ electrician costs to set up your home to charge your EV quickly\n- Shorter ranges\n\nIf you ask people to make all of those sacrifices, you have to be exemplary in other ways. The best way to do that is to offer features at no cost when it doesn't cost you anything to add them. \n\nA normal car company might not do that, but Tesla doesn't get to be a normal car company. They are competing with a mature gas car industry and the problem with EVs is that even the best EV still kind of sucks compared to the utility of a traditional car.\n\njust guessing from my own indecisiveness, but if FSD were 3k and white interior was offered at-cost, you'd have a lot more sales because tesla's primary target market probably should be solar-owning homeowners in the sunny south where the interior of cars get scorching hot and batteries don't get hurt by any cold weather. \n\nTeslas run the AC even when the car is off to keep cool though, so you're stuck with a car draining its own range to keep cool when a white interior would make that cheaper",
