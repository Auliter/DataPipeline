        "rawContent": "Will the $25,000 Tesla use faster-charging CATL LFP cells? üîã‚ö°\n\nBattery supplier CATL is developing faster-charging battery cells for Tesla, according to Bloomberg (via Automotive News).\n\nCATL chairman Robin Zeng mentioned this project in an interview with Bloomberg in Hong Kong on Monday, in which he also confirmed that CATL is supplying equipment for Tesla's Nevada battery factory. Zeng also mentioned Tesla's ongoing effort to develop a $25,000 electric car, perhaps hinting that the new cells may go into it.\n\n\"There's always room for cost reduction depending on what the $25,000 car's aim is,\" Zeng said, noting that a \"robotaxi\" wouldn't require cost reduction at the cell level because the longer life cycle of CATL's batteries would keep average cost for that application lower.\n\nSince its 2020 Battery Day, the company has been pushing ahead to make its own cells but hasn't backed away either from sourcing cells from other suppliers. Tesla already uses CATL LFP cells, which cost less to make in money and carbon footprint, in the Model 3 in the U.S., and in the Model Y for some other markets, and it was at one time also considering the LFP-based BYD Blade battery for its vehicles made in China.\n\nCATL, for its part, already boasted last year that its next-generation LFP battery tech can add 250 miles of range in 10 minutes. In addition to Tesla, its customers include BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Ford, which has restarted construction on a Michigan plant making CATL LFP cells under license‚Äîand what Ford touted as a key to future EV affordability.\n\nBiden administration policies have already set a strong policy discouraging Chinese content, although a second Trump administration might apply a different kind of action.\n\nhttps://t.co/CsYTvQX1XH\n\n$TSLA",

        "rawContent": "Dong Maimai: I heard that the world's highest-mileage Tesla has already traveled 2 million kilometers. By the time it reached 1.9 million kilometers, it had already gone through 4 batteries and 13 motors. How expensive are Tesla batteries? In China, replacing one costs about 220,000 yuan each time.\n\nCurrently, the world's longest-distance NIO has reached 570,000 kilometers, and the newest thing on this NIO is probably the battery. In terms of production technology, NIO relies on strong R&D to enhance battery life. Operationally, NIO uses various models to balance the number of battery charge and discharge cycles with power. In some cases, supercharging can significantly shorten battery life due to severe working conditions causing large temperature differences. However, the liquid cooling system at the battery swap station balances the temperature, which, in turn, increases life expectancy.\n\nThe most crucial aspect is maintenance. If a battery swap station needs to repair a battery, it can be removed from circulation on-site in a second. As for in-car battery maintenance, well, that requires a return to the factory and disassembly. In the future, batteries that are extensively glued together in various ctc and ctb configurations will not only be difficult to maintain, but even their retirement and recycling will impact efficiency.I believe that a battery-swapping system based on standardized battery packs will see more and more automakers joining and adopting it. \n\nLooking at the bigger picture, for consumers, buying a battery swap is like having a lifetime warranty on the battery. For companies that offer battery swapping, the cost of each battery is actually low, and they can make money throughout the entire lifecycle, making it beneficial for everyone.The consensus should be that one can buy many electric vehicles, but having one that offers battery swapping as a safety net is essential. $NIO $TSLA",

        "rawContent": "Every day, the Tesla Semi demonstrates that battery electric trucks can directly replace diesel trucks. With our own fleet of Semis, Tesla has shipped >20,000 battery packs out of Gigafactory Nevada to support Fremont vehicle builds. These trucks run the same route, carrying the same load (no load reduction for weight) as the diesel trucks running this route but at substantially lower operating cost. Now, it‚Äôs about scale.\n\nThe EPA Phase 3 rules will help hasten the overall fleet transition to zero emissions and address the harmful particulate emissions and other pollutants from diesel trucks. In combination with the superior economics and experience that battery electric trucks provide, I expect full market adoption will occur faster than many think.",

Tesla teams have visited earlier too and even been in discussions with states.\n\nMost likely candidates are Gujarat and Maharashtra.\n\nA Tesla GF would lead to local investment from suppliers too, not just Tesla. If they go for local cell production, cell raw material providers would see a boost too. \n\n- https://t.co/t5zqyvp8qj",
