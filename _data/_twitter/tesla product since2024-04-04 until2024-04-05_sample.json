And I'm happy to be proven wrong.\n\nTesla is a cool company with an awesome product.\n\nBut, be very wary of narratives vs. facts.\n\nI've been told time and time again that Tesla's true optionality is outside of cars.  With software, FSD, batteries, solar and green energy.\n\nAuto makes up >85% of top line sales.  It is what it is.  The numbers are gravity which bring you back to reality.\n\nForward looking narratives and an investment thesis rooted in an optimistic future is great.  But, it needs to be grounded in fundamentals.  End rant.  Open to counter points, learning more and being open minded if you have anything you think I'm getting wrong.\n\nRed = total auto revenues\nblue = energy gen + storage\norange = share price",
